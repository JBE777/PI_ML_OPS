title,review
Lost Summoner Kitty,"Simple yet with great replayability. In my opinion does ""zombie"" hordes and team work better than left 4 dead plus has a global leveling system. Alot of down to earth ""zombie"" splattering fun for the whole family. Amazed this sort of FPS is so rare."
Lost Summoner Kitty,It's unique and worth a playthrough.
Lost Summoner Kitty,Great atmosphere. The gunplay can be a bit chunky at times but at the end of the day this game is definitely worth it and I hope they do a sequel...so buy the game so I get a sequel!
Lost Summoner Kitty,"I know what you think when you see this title ""Barbie Dreamhouse Party"" but do not be intimidated by it's title, this is easily one of my GOTYs. You don't get any of that cliche game mechanics that all the latest games have, this is simply good core gameplay. Yes, you can't 360 noscope your friends, but what you can do is show them up with your bad ♥♥♥ dance moves and put them to shame as you show them what true fashion and color combinations are.I know this game says for kids but, this is easily for any age range and any age will have a blast playing this.8/8"
Lost Summoner Kitty,"For a simple (it's actually not all that simple but it can be!) truck driving Simulator, it is quite a fun and relaxing game. Playing on simple (or easy?) its just the basic WASD keys for driving but (if you want) the game can be much harder and realistic with having to manually change gears, much harder turning, etc. And reversing in this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥, as I imagine it would be with an actual truck. Luckily, you don't have to reverse park it but you get extra points if you do cause it is bloody hard. But this is suprisingly a nice truck driving game and I had a bit of fun with it."
Ironbound,Very fun little game to play when your bored or as a time passer. Very gud. Do Recommend. pls buy
Ironbound,A suitably punishing roguelike platformer.  Winning feels good.  Progressive unlocks mean a good slog ending in failure doesn't feel like a waste.
Ironbound,"""Run for fun? What the hell kind of fun is that?"""
Ironbound,"Elegant integration of gameplay, story, world development and aesthetic."
Real Pool 3D - Poolians,"Random drops and random quests, with stat points.  Animation style reminiscent of the era before the Voodoo card."
Real Pool 3D - Poolians,Fun balance of tactics and strategy.  Potential for very rewarding battles on smaller maps.  Can become a bit of a grind on larger maps (>200 stars).
Real Pool 3D - Poolians,"Fun world builder, with plenty of option of how you want challenge served to you.  Gnome pathing sometimes frustrating if you expand very very quickly."
Real Pool 3D - Poolians,"This game... is so fun. The fight sequences have been improved from walking dead. It also includes more of a Sam and Max puzzle solving (some of it in the first episode) and walking dead. The game also gets even more better if you have read the Fables comic books, which are without a doubt, very good. The music is also superb and fit the scenarios very well."
Real Pool 3D - Poolians,"Really Really Really Great Game, very good story, im in chapter 1 atm and i think its great. You get a really early link with characters. No need to play the first game, its nicely wrapped up for you in a five minute video. FYI beware of the sex scenes :P, nudity does happen in the game and it shows you actually having sex, so try not to play with your parents around if your near a point in the story. Also you will need a good rig/comp to play on high. Don't even try running the game on Ultra unless you have mulitiple GPU's (Graphics card) and ram and a good processor. All in all good game :D"
弹炸人2222,"Just buy it already. Great Story, Great Multiplayer and good fan service. Just awesome game. Just using shootdodge and bullet time makes you feel like a badass. Also, its better if you get the max payne story recapped or replay the first two but its not necessary."
弹炸人2222,"It was a great game from what I played, right now I need to find the actual download."
弹炸人2222,"The ending to this game is.... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.... Just buy it, you'll be invested, im automatically preordering season two of the walking dead game."
Battle Royale Trainer,"Alan wake is a really good game, the light effects are pretty awesome and this game is so good, it paid back remedy their promotion and conversion fees in the first two days on steam. Its awesome :D. Remedy can still make video games, even if its not Max Payne. It is also very character driven."
Battle Royale Trainer,Git gud
Battle Royale Trainer,"It's like Terraria, you play for 9 hours straight, get endgame armour then stop playing until the next update."
SNOW - All Access Pro Pass,"Hold shift to win, Hold CTRL to lose."
SNOW - All Access Pro Pass,"OH YES, THIS GAME IS THE BEST, THEY ADD STUFF LIKE NEW CHARACTERS, AND LIKE A NEW MAP ONCE A YEAR, IT'S SO AWESOME, OH YES, IT'S SO AWESOMENAUTS, YES, YES, I'M GOOD AT THIS, YES, YES, GOOD, I'M GOOD, YES, GOOD, YOU ARE BAD, IM GOOD, YES, TOO GOOD, YES, IM NOT BAD, YES, GOOD."
SNOW - All Access Pro Pass,This game is Marvellous.
SNOW - All Access Pro Pass,"It reminds me of that TV Show called ""The Walking Dead""."
SNOW - All Access Legend Pass,This game is fantastic if you are looking to DEADicate some time to it.
SNOW - All Access Legend Pass,If you like defending dungeons then I suppose this game would suit your needs.
SNOW - All Access Legend Pass,You don't have to get this game. It's not like it's the greatest FPS of all time or anything. But have a think about it.

Planetarium 2 - Zen Odyssey,MAGICKA *SNORT* *SNORT*
Planetarium 2 - Zen Odyssey,"Amazing, Non-stop action of blowing stuff to bits, Decapitation and shooting everything you see. With a combination of action, thriller and emmersive gameplay, as well as enviromental challanges (Jump physics). This game will really put your eyes to the test, can you see the enemys before they see you? Cause their are so many!This is the second level of the killing floor, I quote bill LF4D ""Son we just crossed the street"" But in reality they only moved up an elevator level on genes. What has yet to come as the game is slowly realsed with thrilling and horryfing creations, But who really cares, Let's just blow it up, I invite you to get on the GODAMN KILLING FLOOR, LET'S SHOOT ♥♥♥♥♥ES AND GET PAID! RAHHHHHHHHHHH!"

The first thrust of God,"Amazaing great, Creative and build All I'm going to say."
The first thrust of God,"At first, it looked to me that...""Wow, just another plain game... Minecraft Style I guess...""However, after playing it for almost 2 hours, I've realised that this game...Is nothing like Minecraft in terms on gaming content/adventure.If you've ever wished to get DayZ and want to get a first-hand experience of it, this game will be a great start!I do recommend that you guys play with a friend, and not Single Player (Just yet...)My feeling about this game is that it will become a game that requires intense TeamWork, Co-ordination and communication (Recommend: Use Voice Chat in Steam for the meantime).So for those who feel this game isn't worth playing because it looks boring, please think twice...I would have regretted my choice if I didn't choose to play this game for a while."
The first thrust of God,"Awesome graphics, texture. Reqiures HARDCORE teamwork and Co-Ordination, but all good fun! Go get it now. You won't regret it!"
The first thrust of God,"Upside to PAYDAY 2:+ Updates are released every few weeks or maximum 1 month (Some are free, which is a good thing)+ Gets you feeling acomplished by getting free items after every mission+ Able to retry missions that are of different difficulties (Adds challenge to your gameplay)+ Side Jobs (Everyday and every week) to complete, which gives you free items that you would like to haveDownside to PAYDAY 2:- Game sustainability is low (It's a repetitive gameplay; you will get bored after playing it too often)- You must pay for DLCs that may be more fun than the free ones- Lots of things to take note and get used to (Perks, modifying weapons/masks/comestics, etc)Overall rating: 8.5/10"
The first thrust of God,"Awesome game! It's like L4D2 and Killing Floor, but much more realistic! This game REALLY needs hardcore teamwork, to win Objective Mode and Survival Mode, but other than that, it's really fun and ""Horrific!"""
SNOW - Starter Pack,"Compared to Left 4 Dead 2, this game REALLY gives you the creeps and the adrenaline rush to kill the Patrioch. +1 for this gameAlthough it does need some major improvements to how they put in the designs (Not the zombies, the HUDs).Other than that, GREAT game!Thrilling!"
SNOW - Starter Pack,You won't regret playing it!
SNOW - Starter Pack,Good Game It Was Very Fun!!!!
SNOW - Starter Pack,Good game
The first thrust of God - All Aircrafts,What a Awsome game!
The first thrust of God - All Aircrafts,This Game Doesn't Work
The first thrust of God - All Aircrafts,"I'm going to keep this somewhat short and sweetAt the time of writing, Kerbal space program is in beta and there is talk of how soon it will be until it emerges from beta. But since its release in July 2011, it grown to become an outstanding example of Enthusiasm, Humor, and Profound triamph in a game. No matter whether your accomplishing great feats of exploration and scientific achievement......Or maybe you watched your beloved ship erupt into flames and debris becuase of a fatally unseen flaw. There is always something spectacular to be seen (Like your blown-up ship) or something to have a laugh at (Again like your blown-up ship)My recommendation?Buy this game, do something great, do something ridiculous, mod it, find something else just as great and just as crazy to do. My little tip is that i get emotionally attatched to some of my kerbals (Especially Jebediah). There's so much fun to be had and tenderness to experience. There's no reason not to buy this game and experience it. So do it!!!"
The first thrust of God - All Aircrafts,"I've always liked games like Terraria with the 2 dimensional survival and exploration aspect and Starbound does all these well and MORE!Lets start with its soundtrack: To sum it up in one paragraph would do it injustice. This games soundtrack is fully orchestral and imersive. The music just fits perfectly where-ever you are in game. Whether you are spelunking or just flying through the vast expanse of space it fits perfectly and leaves you in awe.Ok onto the graphics: The look and feel of this game bring the vast worlds to life with the many colors and alien dirts, trees and the mixture of monsters. The backgrounds of the planets match up the the foregrounds well and give the 2d aspect that 3d feel.Now the gameplay: Starbound has a nice rich layer of gameplay revolving around survival. In the latest unstable build updates they have introduced a very needed layer of missions and npc quests which fullfil the gaps of just flying from planet to planet and give purpose.Starbounds worlds have a wide variety of random aspects to them.First off the flora: Flora of planets consists of 2-3 main aspects. The Trees, the small bushes and medium bushes. Each planet has a vast difference to the next in their flora with trees coming in 2-3 different types from metallic trees to plain out alien tentacles.Now onto the fauna: Each planet has 3 or more ground based animals which increase in strength further beneath the planets surface. Starbound has a feature where animals are customized via their limbs and body. There are many arms, legs, feet and bodies all just jumbled to together from monster to monster making cute monsters and just plain out terrifying ones. There are also around 2 bird species per planet. Using the same general system.I personally suggest this game because of its deep and fluid experience and its wide modding community.8-9/10 for an early access and its only going to get better!"
The first thrust of God - All Aircrafts,Best first person shooter
SNOW - Lifetime Pack,"Well, need a multiplayer option"
SNOW - Lifetime Pack,AWESOME
SNOW - Lifetime Pack,Hermoso juego que nunca olvidare <3
SNOW - Lifetime Pack,"One of the best sequals i have every seen, rebellion dose a great job of refining and improving. the X-ray mechanic is vastly improved.One thing in particular i dont like is the new leveling system and having to unlock weapons, but then again it gives the game massive replayabily through the open-ended levels making you want to go back for more and get those weapons, but personal opinion i like V2's weapon unlock system.great game worth every dollor, 9/10"
The Warrior Of Treasures,"If you're looking for a no frills, Arcade/Simulator Style Dog fighting game you have come to the right place."
The Warrior Of Treasures,For $5 this game is worth your time.Pretty easy to pick up and play with simple controls and fun gameplay. dont be worried that the game will be runied by microtranactions cause they dont really change the game at all.Graphics have a really nice feel the them and sound is really good.Hopfully this game will pave the path for future halo games to come to PC.

RC Plane 3 - F-53B,"♥♥♥♥♥ charged me 80 now its 15 dollars, got boring after about 5 hours."
RC Plane 3 - F-53B,"Chivalry Deadliest Warrior = Best game, needs more players though"
RC Plane 3 - F-53B,"a fun game that gets ridiculously hard on harder difficulties, suits any music you choose to play or just the in game music.ive played most of my hours in this game when my net drops out (hence the hours) and have been playing since it was in beta. not sold on the daily challenge but the new station is an interesting consept. overall... love the game, 8.5/10, would reccomend to fast thinkers."

Vaporwave Simulator,Just amazing
Vaporwave Simulator,Very very fun. 2.2.5 is nice and fun and the beta for 3.0 is very enjoyable with constant updates and lots of content per update. GG
Vaporwave Simulator,This game Is great.Its charmingits imersiveits funAnd it works every time for me. I have no idea what others are complaining about.Anyways.In my opinion i like it even slightly better than Gta 5 which i own.it has such a good story and ypu can dictate the story on several occasions like choosing to kill or not kill somebody which affects you later on positively or negativly or choosing weather to accept an offer or not.The combat is imersive. as you harm an enemy their preformance goes down and you cand shoot them a mlion times in the hand to kill them. This is still up for a little improvementsMods can be very fun and after finishing the story i reccomend installing one after finnishing the story.However you should install an ENB asap because it greatly enhances the graphics.

DEFCON,"Really good definately Recommend getting this game, Super Addictive 10/10"
The Ship: Single Player,es muy increible OwO
The Ship: Single Player,best game ive played in my life
The Ship: Single Player,"This game has an excellent style of fighting with high amounts of diferent weapons to use from. With the help of the hl2 engine, the graphics, models of weapons and characters, this deserves one of the best shooters game of all time. As well as this, map-making is avaliable to all people who are willing to do it, same with plugins for custom servers, Source Film Maker and many more things. This is overall a stunning game that I have played for a while and deserves a yes. GG Valve.Some things that may put it down, however, would be the fact that some recent updates are very similar in terms of style. For example, the Gun Mettle update brought in contracts, new maps, etc. The halloween update brought in the same thing, but just different missions.People who play other shooter games, that are like COD, Battlefield, etc. One thing i would have to say to those people would be, don't shout at the medic to run to you and specifically YOU because apparantely YOU are the one carrying the team with your gibus and goggles and your natascha, family business and your eviction notice. Pub doesnt work like that, sunshine.As well as this, don't be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to the new kid or some ♥♥♥♥ just because you got screwed over when you were new. At some point this new kid will have a better inventory, (yes i know just because having an expensive inventory doesnt make you a better player) better items, and a better fighting style. TF2 doesnt need those kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥ on their servers.Either way, although there are some parts of the years to come that will be lazy, there will be better things introduced. Frankly, i want some new weapons, they've been just introducing reskins. Example, Batsaber.Yes."

Wolfenstein 3D,"Once all the twelvies aren't playing, and you're up against people who know what they're doing, it's a great game. When all slots are filled it's highly balanced. It's controls are responsive and nothing beats sniping a shark while hanging upside down in the corner with a harpoon.The only problem is the AI. In a game where majority of the gameplay is based off line of sight, and moving without being seen, an AI really destroys it. They can always see you, and never miss as a shark or a diver. They ruin any game almost instantly, but besides that, it's worth buying it when it's on sale.Not entirely sure if it's worth paying full price however, as that's around $80 for you and 3 other friends. And it isn't completely worth paying full price for it."

QUAKE Mission Pack 1: Scourge of Armagon,Otimo game
Spear of Destiny,คุ้มกับที่ซื้อมามันส์มากครับ
BloodRayne,This game killed my social life and the mods hauled it to the granite crematorium.
QUAKE Mission Pack 2: Dissolution of Eternity,"I's freaking rad and the ingame graphics are wonderful. Not great latency for Aussie players though, even on the closest servers."
QUAKE,"Simple, endlessly replayable, catchy music, this has all the hallmarks of a classic.A few bugs, but it's frequently updated so they're quickly caught.9/10 stars."
Genesis Rising,10/10 would take kids here for birthday
"Warhammer® 40,000: Dawn of War® – Winter Assault","Well for starters, when I write reviews they are usually just for the lols. This is not the case. This game is genuinely a masterpiece and i have never played a game that made me feel so many emotions that range all over the spectrum, i mean hell I thought The Last of Us was emotional as hell. one minute its happy then desparation then wanting to cry like a baby (points in the game specifically made me question my manhood due to how much i was trying to not break down like a baby) this game honestly does show alot of great points that are true in real life as well, like value those close to you and despite this being the internet and it not being known to be shown but, showing compassion and taking the time to give a helping hand could possibly save someones life. It is funny that a troll on tf2 would find such a great love and change of perspective from a game, call me names call me what ever the hell you like. I never thought i would go deep about a game but simply put this game, while it may not be for everyone, is a really great game and i honestly say it is worth more that just 20 dollars. 100/10"

"Warhammer® 40,000: Dawn of War® - Game of the Year Edition","Seriously, this is one of the best starwars games there is! critics were stupid how they rated it, well concidering how it is the most sold starwars game, i highly recommend it to any other starwars geeks out there like i am."
"Warhammer® 40,000: Dawn of War® - Dark Crusade","Where do I begin...I trusted you Bethesda. From all the time I spent with FO3... I never could have imagined this garbage is what you'd spew up from the depths of whatever 'creative' hell it came from. I thought you would learn from what Obsidian did with New Vegas, more depth - more REALISM.The map is smaller than Skyrim, Todd. Not in length, or width, but in the sense that the little things are missing. The special touch and charm that is just on the cusp of every corner you'd turn in the previous fallout titles is missing... The environment feels hollow, too vibrant, too smooth. It's not the same Fallout theme I grew to crave and felt wonder at. You traded something original, something special, from those wonky shooter mechanics to the skill bar and karma system, for what? better FPS mechanics and a more 'console-friendly' interaction system? I would suggest that all digital copies are wiped and the physical copies piled into a garbage dump like Atari did when E.T. the Extra Terrestrial failed... but I digress...This game should serve as a warning to those who find themselves with an IP as significant as the Fallout Universe. It's like they say - ""IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT!"" Do yourself a favour and buy Fallout: New Vegas, instead of this $80 squirming feeling of regret and hopelessness."
Rome: Total War™ - Collection,"I spent way too much time on this game early on in highschool, may or may not have led to me dropping math as a subject. Besides that, this game doesn't feel the same as it did 5 years ago. In my personal opinion the new content  scheme they've borrowed from one of their other games, CS:GO, shows a stark indication of how much damage the newer updates have wreaked on the TF2 community. The new guns/skins look awful, it's a transplant from CS gone wrong. It's a lot more toxic, and competitive in TF2 now, F2P destroyed the quality of an already degrading player base. Idle and achievement servers fill up the server list completely. TF2, we had a good run... but now it's time for this grizzled mercenary to hang up his hats."

Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3,fsdgfdsgsdfgfd
PuzzleQuest: Challenge of the Warlords,Best game I have ever played and a thousand times even better when you download mods
Culpa Innata,"3 years I've played this game and although that doesn't seem as much as a lot of people due to the fact that this game is one of the oldest on Steam people questioned me why I played it and some even made fun of me for it. The TF2 community might be at the lowest yet with the new Tough Break update but still even if the biggest people in TF2 such as Jerma985 and Star_ are sick of it I am not it just shows how much this game has dragged me back to it even if I rejected to,eventually I would return and play because I know I want to most my friends that I played TF2 with I barely even see play it but I don't care this game is one of the most special games I've ever played and it was one of the very first games that I've actually stuck around on others I got bored of after getting sick and tired of their repetitive style but still for some reason this game is the only one where I won't stop even if I want to.I'll get to the point of it now I absolutely LOVE and I mean LOVE this game no matter what people tell me about how it isn't as competetive as CS:GO or it is stupid because of how they're always hats on people's heads this game is different from your normal FPS games you actually have to work as a team well to win the game not just run around and shoot people its classes are all balanced and don't handle like COD,Battlefield or CS:GO which shows how different it is so why not give it a try if I and many can enjoy it shows no reason why you can't go download TF2 now and I mean NOW Mr."
Culpa Innata,I do hate the fact that I lagged a ton in this game really a shame but other than that this game is GTA online for free and less people and also you can play as cops and....... Well I'm gonna shut up now
Culpa Innata,po cem palavras XD
Prison Tycoon 3™: Lockdown,This game is interesting I think more people should try this
Hunting Unlimited™ 2008,"Great game, would recommend"

Desperados 2: Cooper's Revenge,Who knew that the man on the mens toliet bathroom door was overpowered.
Death to Spies,The game that made me scream at the protaginist to just get the damn girl. Also I CAN TYPE SUPER FAST IN THIS GAME.
Death to Spies,Best neko simulator ever made. They seriously need to make a Vol. 2. AND THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE NEKO GAMES
Act of War: High Treason,"After playing this again, and again, and again i can finally decide that i should make a review for this. This game is amazing especially if you're a south park fan. This game is a RPG styled game, kinda like Mario and Luigi back in time, you can pick a class to choose between: Fighter, Mage, Thief and Jew. For me personally i liked the Fighter the best, his skills were my favourites. This game is worth the money, although it is short if you rush it (Which i didn't) this game will be worth you're time. Have fun!"
RollerCoaster Tycoon® 3: Platinum,"Amazing, Just purely amazing. I loved this game, the sad thing is that it only took me 2 days to finish it. Since i did get the DLC things i played as the criminal, his story was pretty sad. Anyways, this game is just amazing. You should tottaly get this! 10/10"
RollerCoaster Tycoon® 3: Platinum,Very harsh to new players. Combat system is strange but is still sort of playable in a way...Fighting against players who have way more experience against someone with low hours is really the worst.
Act of War: Direct Action,"well, it's a 5/10 for me, i mean it's a great game with wonderful graphics but...you can't even see yourself reload! that's just stupid! and the god dam assualt rifle is useless as crap. Although i did enjoy it a little. I would say you should buy this game if you don't like seeing yourself reload and you like games where you can shoot, build and survive."
Unreal 2: The Awakening,"This is a moving and great game..I don't usally play RPG games at all, but this game.. was a exceptionGood:The Story is rich and full of meaning, your always finding out more things about the characters and backstory throughout the gameIt's easy to learnit may only have 4-5 MAIN levels but they are VERY VERY! well done and good hidden secrets.For a small RPG game, it has aout 5-6 hrs of gametime and i didnt even collect all the sercets!I'm not gonna ruin the game but the endings..actually made me cry alot.. they ARE movingThe Art in this game for the endings and other parts are high detail and truely amazing.A Ton more!Cons:I only have one.. PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER ONEOverall 10/10 on the Wolf ScaleIt is rather sweet and careful constructed story and this game really deserves alot of praise.I will be playing this game again.. I can't get enough of it!"
Unreal Gold,"This has got to be worse than sonic 06'!I played many of the Sonic games as a kid, staying up late nights on my Sega MegaDrive playing Sonic 1-3 and sonic and knuckles ect ect. This is a poor excuse of a gamePros:1. It runs well2. thats about all..Cons:1. Sure the surrounding area's may seem nice, Sonic looks like an unfinished unity model2. The Controls feel too heavy and he drops like a stone when u jump..nothing like how it used to be3. the stages are just.. It doesnt bring any charm back to what the stages were in sonic 1..4. the controls are ♥♥♥♥5. I wasted money on this..Overall..This game is a 2/10.. please dont buy it..Instead.. go buy sonic 1-3 for the sega megadrive on steam...SOOO MUCH BETTER"
Ninja Reflex: Steamworks Edition,Awesome game EVER! :D
Ninja Reflex: Steamworks Edition,"Awesome gameGood way to waste money u have earned on the steam market one stranges and hats.A fast paced short shooter which is very well placed, each character has its own style and when played with it can be enjoyable for everyone. There are tons of mods and things you can do to change this game at your will :)Loads of Custom maps like ScreamFortress, Slender, Surf maps and Mario Party style even.There are loads of game mods, MVM, CTF, Defend and others :)Best game on steam <310/10 "
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell®,"I""ve always been a fan of Police car chases..Now theres a game which allows u to be in the drivers Seat!This is such an awesome gameThe graphics are really good making it feel more alive and more realThe gameplay is great.The only let down in this game which is what i love in most of the need for speeds (PS2 seris included) is that you can't free-roam!But on the flutters rating board it is 9/10"
Far Cry®,10/10Would click hot girls again and hear them moan(Also put a macro on an extra button on your mouse and just toggle it off and on..for fast clicking)lel..also useful for upgrading..
Unreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition,Really good game for starters of portal and LOADS of fun!
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Vegas,BEST GAME EVAR
Silent Hunter® III,"Is this game actually Free to Play ? I don't think so. You can only hunt ONE animal in the game. The rest you have to buy... with REAL MONEY. How can this one is free to play? DON'T play this game, it doesn't even worth your time. Hell, you have to pay to play multiplayer!That being said, ♥♥♥♥ this game and the devs."
Virtual Villagers - The Secret City,"Friend introduced the game.Not really interested in MOBA games.Checked the game on steam.Looked at the reviews.Decided to check it out.Downloaded the game.Started the game.Finished tutorial.Decided to play a match.I won.Decided to play another match.I lost.Still wants to play.I won.Keeps playing forever.My god I can't stop.Please, someone... help.Still playing.Plz....*Power outage*Thank god I'm free!!*Power comes back*Mother f...11/10 Best drug evah."

7 Wonders II,"10/10 IGN. Actually such an addictive game, really entertaining and extremely competitive at times!I'd recommend it to you cause its so good thats really it."
Luxor Amun Rising,"At First, I thought that this game would have just been another plain old Terraria type game, But when i started getting the hang of it, it just clicked for me... I Instantly loved the game with all the Beautiful types of planets there are, Species, Items and so much more. This game is definitly deserving an instant Buy Even in its Early Build! But i know for sure that as this game progresses with newer builds and Versions, I know for sure that it will be well worth money spent :DIf you have spent your time to read this Review, then Thank You and i truly Recommend that you Buy this game cause its Soo Addictive and Exciting :D"
Luxor 3,"this game is highly thought out, the way the community is always workshopping new ideas for the game, the thrill of owning an unusualor australium and cosmetics is amazing, the team is nice, admins and server players are always good to meet =) Personal rating- 9/10, great game :)"

Midnight Outlaw: 6 Hours to SunUp,"Animu Waifus.Oh wait. There are three of them!Let's talk about Japan, their food, idols and ANIME!!Overall, it is a enjoyable game with it's share of a stupid character. (i.e. you. He's a freaking dumbass)What is my life right now"
Bone: The Great Cow Race,"This game is a beautiful game that shows a new storyline, the same location and a new combat style that changes the pace from the first game. Visually this game is beautiful, and exploring Rapture again was encredibly enjoyable. Being an actual Big Daddy makes you feel more badass, unlike in the first game,  which just makes you feel like a person with a Big Daddy Suit  This is a very underrated game that has a dense storyline, beautiful setting and a new way of approaching combat.I recommend this game with the whole of my heart and everyone who buys this game will enjoy it."
Sprint Cars Road to Knoxville,"This Game is laggy for my computer because mine kinda sucks but this game is incredibly hard and challenges your hand-eye co-ordination with a single key for a finger and also needs your mouse, but this game is more for mucking around so this game is incredibly enjoyable and funny. i recommend this to anyone who has a great computer and is incredibly bored."
Ride! Carnival Tycoon,"PayDay 2 on the difficulty scale -Normal - ""lolwut""Hard - ""Ain't even hard""Very Hard ""Dude, do you even cloak?""Overkill - ""When you walk outside and there's like 100 tasers""Death Wish - ""It's harder than Anal"""
Mahjongg Investigations: Under Suspicion,"It's a great TDM style game.Motto of the game - git gud skrub.not Call of Duty 10000/1010/10 IGN ""Would Play again"""
Dracula Origin,Better than MineCraft
Sherlock Holmes - Nemesis,"Far Cry 3 is an extrodinary game, but there are some bugs with the Sniper Rifle and Recurve Bow Scopes, with the Crosshair invisible, which in my case I cannot fix, which is incredibly annoying but you will eventually get used to putting the enemy on the middle of the screen, but the gameplay in general is great with an open world experience, where you can explore and do whatever you want, so it is very enjoyable. In conclusion, this game is very enjoyable to people who like open world environments, with massive amounts of firearms and stealth."
Sherlock Holmes - Nemesis,"This is an enjoyable game at first with a variety of different and creative weapons this can make you buffed or less buff, it WILL get repetetive after a while and it becomes incredibly boring but like Left 4 Dead 2 playing the game with breaks will make it more enjoyable."
Eternity's Child,"Nice serious nice game ,"
Eternity's Child,"Muito bom , recomendo a todos, jogo muito bom com grafico simples cuidado muito viciante :3 (ADORO JOGOS VICIANTES) *-*"
Pacific Storm Allies,the structural integrity says it all if you like destroying and buliding things knowing that it can crumble into hundreds of pieces Please do buy it so the team can make future games like this. Well Done guys!!!!
Pacific Storm Allies,"I was playing this game on high graphics (optimal graphics) and as i was playing i noticed down in the bottom left corner it said that my laptop was killing itself and i was like oh no s i clicked it and i said TACTICAL NUKE INBOUND!!! an i began o notice pixels tearing and exploding and my camera on the game turned towards the mountains in the distance and i aw 3 tsar bombs explode and y computer started smoking and it said WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!!!!! about 85,000,000 times ad my computer blew up sort of like a nuclear bomb so thanks activison. :)Jut joking you guys did a very good job with this game people say ♥♥♥♥ about this game but its only in its very first stages and not many games can be as good as this. Thanks for the excellent BETA!!!!!"
Tank Universal,"Arma 3 Was An Outstanding Continuation From its previous game Arma 2, the things i love about this game is the sheer liberty to do what ever you want with limitless possibilities like flying a helicopter in races death Matches tank wars sniping driving and even content creation, how could it get any better,Cons: listen the game is absolutely amazing in perspective but there is a little bit of a let down, if you dont know already the amount of vehicles and weapons immensely decreased since arma 2, Where is our hind f35 or even and f18 or at least a black hawk. So there you are that was my opinion on the game Arma 3 Yours Sincerely, BLAZE 420XX"
Tank Universal,Yep thats it
FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage,"love the game, just needs to work more on bug fixes!"
Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus®,this game is a waste dont buy......

X-COM: UFO Defense,Amazing RPG
S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky,It's a good game to play when you have a 7 day ban on CS:GO.
S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky,Best. Game. Ever...Until I got VAC banned.
Crysis Warhead®,Never played Half-Life before but it's a great game!
Crysis,KennyS is France but for Cloud9 he is the American stars.
X-COM: Interceptor,This game is one of the best games I have ever played it is even better then COD by a mile SO you should get this game wirth the money by alot
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,"So I play ARK on and off with my friends because it’s just fun to join servers and scurry to make a settlement or base and bicker about who own what dinosaurs. Then I get told by one of more hardcore ARK friends that they added payed DLC. This shows me that the developers still care for this game and its players, and they wanted to enhance their player experience with new ones. I feel sorry for the games development team for having to deal with all these entitled precious little children that believe that they are owed free content just for playing for an extended amount of time. Keep up the good work ARK devs. Until you reach DayZ levels of lazy then you have done nothing wrong by me."
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,Great way to learn Russian!♥♥♥♥
Multiwinia,"So after 30 odd hours i thought i'd write a reasonable review because my thoughts on this game have changed alot. So at first i wasnt so keen on ubisoft relaseasing another game so shortly after Unity, which i think i speak for everyone, despite an attempt at a next-gen engine, it was still average at best. Rogue to me feels like im playing the best bit of the AC franchise, The ship from AC4 and the same unchanged New York map from AC3 to name a few. Some elements from previous multiplayer have also been added in, despite there being an actual multiplayer. My main attractions to Rogue would be the tie-ins to other parts of the franchise, the expansion on the Kenway saga from Black Flag, the Birth of Achillies and his part in AC4 (seems like a sequel, Fast and Furious flash back anyone, *cough* Han *cough*). This also raises another issue i have however, these connections seem very much like Ubisoft are tying loose end to the AC4 and AC3 series, which we saw happen in revelations. Obviosuly this game is far better than Revelations, but is it? im not saying rogue is a cash cow but if the same thing is happening again and ubisoft are working on something in the background, Rogue is nothing more than a slight o' hand (see the pirate reference?), a very visually appealing one at that, they went pretty hard out with this one, even if it is just tying up loose ends and mamking the whole Benjamin Franklin and Achilies issues seem more realistic, it was worth it. Touching on that further, despite being released after PS3/4 and XB360/1, Rogue also had a lower realease cost, which also leads me to believe there is more in store for his franchise, this is in no way the end, ubisoft opened a can of worms by releasing the Templar play with Shay and i personally think it will breathe new light into a somewhat dying franchise.Some things i disagree with:- Bring back the crouch, creates a better sense of realism, i literally walked passed enemies and no one even battered an eye lid. (not legit)- Bring back multiplayer, even if it was only the sailing, i would play that for hours. Seriously, that would have made this game epic. - Hunting is no fun, i dont know anyone who enjoys the hunting challenges.Give this one a go, if you liked the ship from AC4 and Black Flag then its even better here Rogue, Also there is less ""land play"" which made me happy.Have to congratulate Ubisoft here, well rounded game, stable enough for a PC version of AC, playable and enjoyable. P.s Dont take the ship away again.Cheers,Lordelicious."
STCC - The Game 1 - Expansion Pack for RACE 07,"Awesome game, very addictive and truely immerisve. It presents a very basic challenge, to get through the map, however it take something so siple with one movement, jumping, and makes you feel like your hands are painted on and before you know it you're in the feotal position wondering where the hours went. Truly recommend this game."
Children of the Nile: Alexandria,it did not send my code play! waste of money
Children of the Nile: Alexandria,I Really LOVE this game!This is the best game for social interaction and wasting your money.
Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization,its hard to get used to but its awsome when you can learn new skills and tricks
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® 3 Gold,i love the game and i recommend this game and i hope a update comes because we need sandbox mode please for the people who want money and items
LEGO Batman,i like how a small game can be this popular
LEGO Batman,really fun!
City Life 2008,honestly it's ok for a card game.it need improvement but in time the gam will get better just right now its just a ok game not 10/10 material.i would rate this game a 6/10
City Life 2008,really fun game
Hinterland,This game is far better than COD. The first time played this game I fell in love immediently.
Hinterland,THIS GAME RULS
Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway™,hi
Gravitron 2,Y U NO PLAY! PLAY NOW DANG IT NOW!
Gravitron 2,This game is Eshays!!!
Xpand Rally Xtreme,This game is heaps sick!
Heroes of Might &amp; Magic V: Hammers of Fate,"Great game, you can tell just by the number of people reviewing this game negatively with over 100h (or 400h) played.Sure there are a few bugs, but the devs are working hard on fixing stuff, communicate with the community and release patches with a lot of new content every other month.This is a game based on grinding, and sometime it will take time to get your gears just the way you want it. But the DZ is a great experience, with some balancing issues that will shift the meta of the game strongly towards a build here and there.Haven't seen a hacker in 2 months (playing the DZ fairly often, rank > 82). People saying the game is full of hackers are the same guys that get rekt in CS and call hacks on everyone.  I strongly recommend this game for both the PvE and the PvP aspect."
Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood™,Loads of fun. Motions of the character really makes me feel like a Ninja!
Heroes of Might &amp; Magic V: Tribes of the East,The best FPS of all times. A lot of DLC coming regularly. Kudos to valve !
The Settlers®: Rise Of An Empire Gold Edition,Stellaris is better.
Brain Spa,"This Game Gives ME POWER OF UNIMAGINABLE FORCE, with the strength i recive i shall be able to become the true otaku .......Don't play this game its weird and lovely at the same time :)"
The Sum of All Fears,this game is good
Peggle™ Nights,"Nice game, can be very creative here! although a bit of P2W, I'm still loving it :)"
World of Goo,"this game is good, easy to play and have alot fun with it. although im already lvl 8, i still find it not that hard to even challenge all these P2W guns and players. To everyone, i would recommend this game to you!  :3"
X3: Terran Conflict,WTF Keeps CRASHING PLZ FIXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX USED TO BE AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
X3: Terran Conflict,"Bad,people just spam 1 op character 1/10"
X3: Terran Conflict,"This game is awesome. Its like minecraft and dayz combined, with the voxly box world this game utilizes, its like a more mature version of minecraft, without the high stakes and risk of losing your gear, unlike dayZ, 7days to die is more forgiving. Playing this game by yourself is good to see what you can build in the time but its even more fun to play with friends. Don't mistake this as minecraft though, i Find it brings a more personal touch to a survival game."
Mare Nostrum,I would recommend this game as it is good for fans of the old dayz mod for ARMA 2. Although there are many glitches and exploits this game is in early access and has definitely surpassed any early access game to date.
Spectraball,Whats 1000 - 7? thats what this reminds me of ;P. It is still a decent game and the fact that it is the first free magic the gathering game is amazing :D. The only thing i dislike about Magic Duels are the deck building limitations.
Spectraball,"Do you want to die alot? Do you want to rely on vehicles? Out of 10 want to get spawned killed? This is the game for you. Highly tactical, intense, massive, great game."
Galactic Bowling,This is an awesome game. May overtake team fortress 2. This game is an awesome shooter. You play as different classes and like blacklight retribution you need to spend time farming coins to unlock characters for ever or you can wait for monthly trial rotations of the characters. Is great to play with friends and solo.
Galactic Bowling,this game is a hyper realistic hardcore shooter. Only attempt this game if you are patient enough with dieing in two long range bullets to the body. Great strategical game although map design could be made clearer. Great game and i highly recommend this game.
Galactic Bowling,"This is a great game, an fps tactical game that is more aim and team work than cod, ""run around and spray and pray hoping to god that the server lag is in your favor"" Overall counter strike global offensive is a great map with a good community base, exammple the over watch, although the people you play with may be toxic or the best/funniest people to play with. Warning, if you play this game, and you seek short periods of fun, then casual and deathmatch are the way to go, that and arms race, don't play competitive match making if you don't have atleast 45 minutes to 1 hours worth of time for one game. Thats right, you need a lot of time to play competitive match making, let alone get good at the game that way. Otherwise i would recommend this game as it is enjoyable and not too over the top."
Bully: Scholarship Edition,Best Saints Row game in this series. The most fun i have had in a game of this type. This will definitely beat the newest one aswell. I recommend
Bully: Scholarship Edition,"This is one of the best FPS games i have ever played, although it is a good idea to get a beafy pc before you play"
Far Cry® 2: Fortune's Edition,AN ENDLESS AMOUNT OF EVERYTHING!
Space Trader: Merchant Marine,this is one of the most badass games i have ever played... do wish somethings from SR3 was added though
Space Trader: Merchant Marine,"a really good game in my oppinion, gets boring quickly though (unless playing with friends)"
Space Trader: Merchant Marine,its a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game
PRR Wagon Pack 01,"It's a good game, mechanics seem solid and the players are good (Depending on where you go, ofcourse). Only problem I have with the game is that it runs like ♥♥♥♥ on slower machines, compared to other games like Rust."
"Class 421 London South East ""Jaffa Cake""","Well, I don't have much to say about the game. The North American shut down, leaving only European servers. As an Australian, I rarely, if ever, get a stable connection to Europe. i.e, I can't play the game at all. I can't even launch it.EDIT: I managed to get into the game. It looks okay, loading time is a little long for what the game looks like. But that's okay. I managed to get into a match, even with enough people in the queue I think they were all AI's, they had first/last names. Maybe the playerbase is just weird. The big problem was aforementioned connection issues. I couldn't do anything, Moving was constant rubber banding between where I started and where I was trying to move to.Don't get me wrong, it looks like a decent game. I'd play this. But I can't recommend it with such atrocious servers, and not even having servers for everyone else. If there were North American servers, i'd recommend this game."
ATSF Wagon Pack 01,"It's a pretty good game, not bad for the 49 cents I got it for. Although I do have some issues with it, a few of the enemies feel badly designed, and the projectiles (Or the hitbox) are bigger than they look. Especially the unkillable ones that take up 80% of the screen/completely block your bullets."
GP20 Union Pacific Add-on Livery,"Buy it. Support it. It's awesome. I will find you if you don't.^ Kek, what an old report.Personally I think you shouldn't play this game, although it might get better in a few years.I bought this game as soon as it came out, I bought the founders two pack. It was fun, pretty buggy, but it was full of promise. Skip forward a few years later. The game is worse. Lets talk about starting the game. The game is slow to start. Starting a game will take just as long, and when you get into the game itself, prepare for unoptimized slowness. The game runs terribly, is riddled with bugs and the devs generally don't add any new content. If this was developed by a good indie team, or an AAA team (Oh, did i forgot to mention they fired several people who worked at Bioware, and hired some scrubs?), it would be amazing. The concept is great, I would have really looked forward to this game shining, but the devs are horrible. I do not recommend this game."

Knights of Honor,一部小岛秀夫的游戏，游戏中居然还出现了这句话，算是konami对玩家的妥协么
Ceville,深夜的时候匹配会遇到derank的智障，而且两个一起踢都踢不掉
Ceville,为了不掉lp，玩到快被干掉的时候突然就拔网线，请以后增加一个排名冷却好了，谁先掉冷却他一天再说.顺便一提我人在国外，联机没啥问题，网战排除以上因素以外总体上来说还是很happy的
Ceville,我想说，退款的都是sb
Empire: Total War™ - Special Forces Units &amp; Bonus Content,"除了卖的太贵,士兵模型大多数国家都一样外，没有什么缺点"
Watchmen: The End is Nigh,这个游戏里的物理引擎碉堡了，自由落体，碰撞，杠杆，摩擦，如果出了水和浮力的话就完美了
Penumbra Overture,如果拿来和ps2版的98um来比的话，阉割太严重，本来的3d背景居然又变回老98的2d背景了，语言只有日英，ps2版都不止两种。还有为什么不把ps2版的画廊和自定义配色搞进来？
Penumbra Overture,这代感觉恶搞的内容多了很多，外星人，僵尸，各种恶搞政府，种族歧视，资本家，环保，媒体的节目。感觉这是不是要像黑道圣徒靠拢的节奏，相比之下我觉得以前那种混帮派打地盘招小弟的乐趣减少了有些可惜。
Penumbra Overture,育碧的游戏还是那么一个问题，收集要素太多余了，重复的任务太多了，主线故事太短，我大概玩了50个小时通关吧其中是有30个小时花在解锁塔，解锁前哨，撕海报，打面具，找日记上。前两者还好，后三者有意思吗？无非是看见了就长按一下E，要不就扔个燃烧瓶，要不就打一枪。钱也是如此，虽然道具众多，但是只能拿来卖钱，而游戏里的钱解锁完全部枪支后基本就没用了，收集要素也是，收了一半就满级了，所以我认为如果主线剧情再长一些，武器再多一些，敌人种类再多一些（比如来点坦克），技能树再丰富一些，游戏会做得更好。其实仔细去玩的话游戏中的细节其实挺有趣的，还原野生动物捕猎的场景，npc的各种反应和蹩脚英语，但是短暂的主线任务和麻烦的收集要素弄的玩家们根本无暇欣赏这些细节，联机也基本上鬼服了。阿弥托那么漂亮，沙巴尔那么帅，非要二选一真是逼死强迫症，而且这两条线路结局根本没啥区别好吧。而且这作一个妹子也没泡到，阿弥托，尤真，竞技场妹子，特么一个香艳镜头都没有。最后决战的关卡也不够带感，如果放到cod里就是第一关的水准，不过我也不期望干爹明建造核弹发射井之类的剧情了。干爹明这个角色塑造得很成功，不能跟他打天下实在是遗憾，反正黄金之路也说不上是什么好人，阿弥托照样贩毒，沙巴尔继续搞迷信，仔细想想，和现实世界的恐怖分子也没啥区别。总体上来说，我给游戏8分，如果游戏任务和剧情能丰富到上古卷轴那个水平那就是10分神作了。
Unreal Tournament 3 Black,我之所以推荐这款游戏是为了更方便大家看到我要骂他，这游戏本身质量不错，也许是在13出现之前最好的版本，但是玩的人太少了，加上中国锁运行，实在是连不到人，即使连到了ping也巨高，我在澳大利亚跟澳大利亚人连都是200+ping，不要说是我网络的问题，我玩csgo怎么从来没卡过捏，一些bug还没修复，比如古力查力度的2624a伤害根本不科学，而现在盗版的都能联机了，那么估计以后能连到的人更少
Drakensang,看见SAVANT就进来了  实在是太吊了!!
The Graveyard,对新人极度不友好  随便一个服务器延迟上200 没法玩
The Graveyard,后悔了  简直无脑刷刷刷...

The Maw: Brute Force,"ADVERTENCIA:Este Análisis contiene posibles Spoilers. ¡Lee bajo tu propio riesgo!Historia...En esta historia, encarnamos a un científico llamado Gordon Freeman, su trabajo parece ser sencillo… ponerse un traje de protección ""H.E.V"" e ir a la cámara de pruebas. Es allí donde se encuentra el Cristal “GG-3883”, un mineral del planeta Xen que fue capturado para una investigación. Cuando todo marchaba “normalmente” ocurre una pequeña tormenta de portales dentro de la cámara de pruebas seguido de una gran explosión que afecta a todo el sector. Freeman, después de despertar, no solo se encuentra con científicos heridos y/o muertos, sino también con la fauna de Xen que viajaron atreves de una brecha dimensional. Al ver la situación de emergencia en la que se encontraba no solo el sector, sino también todo Black Mesa, inmediatamente sube a la superficie abriéndose paso entre los Xenianos pero al llegar se encuentra con las fuerzas especiales H.E.C.U. que están “silenciando” a todo el personal de Black Mesa y eliminar todas las pruebas del desastre. Al ver la situación, Freeman se mueve a través de todo Black Mesa para llegar al Complejo Lλmbda y cerrar la brecha dimensional antes de que se extienda por todo el mundo…Jugabilidad...Hλlf-Life es una verdadera obra maestra cuando nos referimos a él como un juego “Single Player”, el objetivo del juego es utilizar pensamientos lógicos y nuestro armamento para sobrevivir en un entorno lleno de enemigos con distintas habilidades, también hay situaciones en el que los puzzles (al menos en los primeros días) pueden llegar a ser un problema.Variedad...El arsenal del juego que es muy variado desde armas simples como la Crowbar, Clock 17, Mp5 y Spas 12, hasta armas potentes, tanto militares, experimentales y alienígenas. No es lo único en variación, también hay una gran cantidad de enemigos como los soldados H.E.C.U., las asesinas Blacks Ops, alienígenas de distintos tamaños y poderes e incluso los guardias de seguridad si llegas a causarle heridas intencionalmente. Y la música no se queda atrás, cada escenario tiene su propio ambiente musical que puede generar tensión o adrenalina en el jugador.Innovación...La interacción con los NPC, el modelado y sus animaciones, para su época, eran sorprendentes, a pesar de que en ciertos momentos pueden sufrir de glitches. Los gráficos de ese momento, los efectos de luces y sombras, diseños del entorno y la ambientación, Hacen que el jugador realmente sienta que está dentro del juego, esto es gracias a su motor GoldSrc, una versión modificada del motor Quake.Multijugador...El multijugador de Hλlf-Life tampoco ha quedado de lado, su gran variación de armas, los orificios de bala en las paredes, salpicaduras de sangre o mejor, despedazar los cuerpos de los jugadores, la posibilidad de crear servers dedicados, la gran variedad de mapas incluyendo los oficiales y los que fueron creados por la comunidad, los personajes para controlar aunque en este aspecto hay pocos, aun así el jugador puede agregar más personajes al multijugador aunque los demás jugadores no tendrán la posibilidad de verlo.Mods...Como último punto, el motor GoldSrc, es un motor fácilmente manipulable, tanto que se han creado  varios mods del juego, como los más conocidos como Counter-Strike y Team Fortress, hasta los más olvidados como Deathmatch Classic y Ricochet, aunque estos son mods oficiales, la comunidad ha creado gran variedades de mods como USS Darkstar, Azure Sheep y Sven Coop.Puntos Negativos...Los únicos puntos malos del juego son que en el viaje del inicio es muy largo, aunque esto se puede omitir con la consola, la poca variedad que hay con los aliados, que son solo un científico con cuatro modelos de personajes y un guardia de seguridad, las armas y enemigos de la versión βeta que no aparecieron ni siquiera en el multijugador, y el no incluir la campaña especial “Decay”, un modo de juego exclusivo de Play Station 2 que permite jugar con 2 científicas.GAMEPLAY:             SOUND:                HISTORY:               INNOVATION:★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★DIFFICULTY:            GRAPHICS:              DURATION:             TOTAL:★★★✩✩          ★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★http://store.steampowered.com/app/70"
The Maw: Brute Force,Me sale un error de NAT estricto y me da paja configurarlo...
Obulis,"I'd definitely recommend this game for people who want to expand their vocabulary, but there are a few things I'd like to point out.-While this is almost never required for romance languages, in Japanese, Chinese and Korean, words, Especially adjectives and verbs, can be synonymous but imply different things. This is almost always the case in Japanese, where verbs have transitive and intransitive forms, but this is not listed in the definition, only one form is presented. This means doing research on the word you'll find yourself using more will help you be more fluent in the long run.-So much katakana... I'd like to see really rare kanji forms of words, as they can appear in stories and some videogames (You know, like English games using the words, 'Thee', 'Thou', etc. They're rare because of their age, but they can still find a use in medieval style games!). In fact, I might prefer it that way as I want to learn as much words as possible and converting English to katakana is easy when you learn about how Japanese pronunciation works. Just add a note to say it's rare to avoid confusion.-Some objects are... Odd. I saw this red box and the definition said it was a piggy bank or something, I was confused until I saw a dial, which meant it was a safe. Maybe you should make objects cliched/stereotyped and exaggerated to help people understand with a quick glance.-It doesn't follow spaced repitition, so you can mash the replay button endlessly until you get yourself a star. If you're a serious learner, never press the replay button, as you just bring it back to your short term memory and fail to remember it the next few days, at least space the replays by an hour the *first* time you try it.-Lists make it too easy sometimes, avoid using them and just use the random button, as I found myself just clicking whatever's next to the last object I clicked on, as I was able to remember the next thing I added right after. This is a mnemonic that relies on the location of the object INGAME, so it doesn't really help you learn. If you really want to do lists, run around the whole house clicking random items and adding them to the list, avoiding any sort of order or pattern.And here's some tips for Japanese:-Avoid Romaji, in fact, do kanji, when you don't know a word, you don't know it, there's no improving your ability to decipher meaning from kanji, so just dive right into it. Do kana if you're really keen on learning pronunciation before reading, and want to do it really, really quickly. Same thing probably applies with Pinyin and Hanzi, but I haven't played  the Chinese version so I don't know if Pinyin is provided.-The dots that appear between kana when you look at how to read the kanji is important, memorise the kana in sections divided by the dots, and their associated kanji (e.g. (毎日 [まい＊にち] まい is 毎 and にち is 日)) This is important, words might have multiple readings, and you might get them wrong, but if you memorise at least ONE reading for the kanji, you can type it on a computer, and even get the correct reading by typing the kanji on a dictionary.-While katakana is easy when you know it well enough, sometimes it isn't, as you might say different versions of a word (E.g. Fairy Floss vs. Cotton Candy, (Well, it's neither when translated to Japanese, but you get my point!)) or it's just katakana but isn't based on English, (e.g. パン for bread). Either way, it's nice to learn a ton of katakana in this game as you get badges for it.Other than that, it's good as you'll find objects in an every day home, and the exploration stops you from being bored quickly, and most importantly:It makes you think of (and therefore associate the word you're learning with) objects and pictures, rather than the English translation, which means that you can achieve fluency which allows you to form sentences in the language you want in your head directly, rather than creating an English sentence, translating it to your wanted language, THEN saying, writing or expressing it."
Obulis,"Best game ever, very little P2W, as all payable items actually can be detrimental to your playing skills, an expert who started with bad equipment will have more potential than a new player who uses very high level equipment, as he'll be used to it and fail really badly when there's an event that measures skill only and gives people similar equipment. Also, all high level equipment are sorted by level, so if you can't buy it with ingame currency, it means specialising isn't a very good idea until you get to a higher level. Payable items don't have this restriction, so very powerful equipment can be put in the hands of new players. Keep in mind that all equipment has a bonus, but an equal penalty, making it not ""powerful"" in a linear sense, but if you specialise in a way that suits your playstyle, it makes you more powerful (but doing this early can bar you from changing your strategy and trying new techniques.)In terms of gameplay, everyone is -mostly- equal, some more general and some more specialized, it depends mostly on skill. Some elements are more powerful than others, not statistically, but in usage and opportunities to cast with most effect."
Space Giraffe,"I don't know what all the negative reviewers are blabbing about, I think this game is really unique, as a player of HoN (Only a few days...), DoTA (Maybe only a few months?), LoL (Quite some time), I think Strife is as easy as LoL, not easier.There's also a lot of things in common with DoTA 2 and LoL, they introduce the same things, with a combination of different methods (Baron, Roshan, Cindara), but Strife adds odd things like out of combat regeneration, which I actually think is perfectly fine, all the actual problems lie in normal regeneration.This game has a LOT of potential if balanced right.The meta is a bit undeveloped, due to how supports can do around as much damage as the nukers, and mages can build enough tank items to work like one, but it IS unique in the fact that top and middle are duo lanes, while bottom is usually soloed.The biggest complaint I have, however, is Ray, Strife's Teemo."
Codename: Panzers - Cold War,"i decided to buy it as it had items I wanted, by I think buying them individually is actually cheaper, if someone can calculate the price and put it in the comments section, I'd be happy.Or angry."
Codename: Panzers - Cold War,Played for a bit...enjoyed it. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Teamwork is needed to survive and NEVER GO ALONE or your possibly f*cked. Barricade to keep the safe zones protected no more just shooting zombies in the gut or d*ck and it'll die. This is a great Zombies Sim.

Nancy Drew®: Legend of the Crystal Skull,"Just a heads up to any and all who intend to play Warframe.I have had to battle my way through Paypal/Warframeto get a refund back because of lacking information on the forums to do with a product.It started with just a refund of ingame money, due to no reply for almost a month, i demanded a refund of real money back.Not going into details of what the case was.Paypal, have sided with me, after 14 business days saying my claims are valid and i have a right of refund.Warframes response was to suspend/Ban my account for 20 years, due to this.Just a massive warning to any and all who play this game, they show no compassion nor do they care for your rights as a person. Yes the game is free great, but all they want is your money, the second you ask for a refund due to a real reason, they will bite you in the butt and throw you under the bus.Share this so people are aware, free to play really is not all that great, and warframe have shown that.Due to legal rights at this point in time, i'm unable to show the conversations i've had between paypal and the warframes support until the case is completed."

Thrillville®: Off the Rails™,"In Watch_Dogs I found that the story is great but there are some random things that go on for no reason.  It tends to be laggy unless you have a powerful CPU.   You get a wide selection of people because it randomizes it.  One bad thing the hacking is kinda linear its only things that are ran by computers and it limits you on that you cant go and hack a building to turn their lights off (execpt for blackout but my point is you can turn ONE building off).  The multiplayer is not the best but It is not that bad. sure its confusing on how to join multiplayer for your first time but you figure out sometime.  Note, Get the DLC because it helps the story A LOT.  So my rating for this game would have to be a...  7/10 Not entirly bad but It does have its down points."

It is basically a race to see who can farm the most, so for the people not in a big clan are at a massive disadvantage(shared XP), This also means you cant come into a wipe half way through anymore! it requires many hours if not days just to aqquire anything decent! I hope the devs are reading this! We want Rust back!!"

Bionic Commando: Rearmed,"Freejam? what happened? it seems that all of your money income has been cut into 7/8 of what it used to be. how? (ahahaha) WELL you see GC was bought a lot more frequently than your crrates. you know why? BECAUSE IT WASNT ♥♥♥♥ING RANDOM.Crate complaint: check.Removal of GC and not refunding what was spent is pure greed you shouldn't do that if you want to get those steaks, chicken, vegetables and fruits. You are just killing a game you could have made billions off of just by adding all this crap no one wants. It could have all been avoided if you actually learn't to READ. have fun trying to under stand this. you dont even look at reviews."
Bionic Commando,"Slime Rancher is a very happy place to go to when you have nothing to do just buy the game its fun and really nice to explore (if you dont watch many videos first) The slimes are cute, the gameplay is amazing and the music is fantastic.only problem is the very minimal lag with alot of slimes or a bad graphics card thats the only problem with it. No bugs and i mean NO bugs i could go searching or just play the game normally and just find 0 bugs.and slime stacks WHAT MORE COULD YOU NEED?"
Bionic Commando,2500+ hrs. Nuff said.

Osmos,"What I think personally?This is a really great game, with some smart ideas and good gameplay.This game is better playing with friends but the multiplayer setup is way to confusing to understand (at least for me).even though its in Early Access people still tend to complain about the most stupidest things, like bugs/glitches and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and how dinosaurs can kill you so easily.THEIR ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAURS WHAT DID YOU EXPECT, you can't just go running up to one with a gun, shot it and expect it to die insistently.Aspects:-Its a game where you have to be stealthy and really have to listen (so its best to play with a good headset) and YOU don't want to make too much noise (such as running) near a Dino, because it will hear you. because of   this it really adds to the atmosphere and the environment, and what you would most probably to in a situation like that.-The Dinosaurs are pretty good, since the game is early access there are only a couple of Dino species in the game, Each Dino has a weak point (being the heart and ♥♥♥♥) attacking there does more damage then attacking like the side or neck.they can be a pain to kill but once you do. you get that feeling of accomplishment.-The weapons are alright, you'll be lucky to find a big crate containing a weapon or clothes?But mostly you get ammo for the gun you haven't found, but the weapons do some good damage, just make sure you aim at the right areas of the dinosaurs to do MORE damage.-The map, Oh Boy, THE MAP IS ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING, its huge it has amazing looks and landmarks ^-^The only downside to the map is climbing up slopes, they can be really steep and if you climb up a mountain, half way it will become too steep and you can't climb any further. Plus you can take fall damage from sliding down slops so watch out- Loot Crates do spawn all around the map, and there's certain areas where good loot spawns.Loot mostly contains:WeaponsClothesAmmoHealthFinal:As i said the game is still in early access so not everything is in the game, but it still is a great game to playJust don't ♥♥♥♥ off a T-Rex, okay? Final-Final:So is this  a good game to buy and play: YESIt is worth the $20 you stole"

Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel,"+: Combines aspects from other games in a way that makes the game truly unique in its own way.+: One of the only if any MMO's that allows you to dig on the terrarian itself (although you can't build on the terrain unless it's in your own 'cornerstone' which is basically your own portable headquarters that you craft things at).+: For an MMO this game took an interesting style of graphics that I haven't seen done before (in an MMO).+: A bunch of classes to chose from, all seeming quite different from one another.+: The game is free.+: Can be a good MMO for someone who's never played one.+: You can 'deassemble' a weapon or accessory you don't want to turn it into crafting materials that you may find more useful.(Stating this) Many reviews on here say that the problem with the game is that it takes so long to connect to servers but this has been fixed (to my understanding).-: Although there is a huge arsenal of weapons (that you are pre-assigned based on your class e.g. Shadow Archers will ONLY receive bows) none of them actually change the way you fight or for that matter give you any feeling of variety.-: You progress so quickly that an item you picked up that you may have considered to be really good at the time can quickly become outdated in terms of stats. The game tries to make you feel good with this system of constant rewards and progression although it fails because you don't actually feel accomplished.-: No storyline, NONE.-: This game is repetitive, most of your objectives in this game are basically 'kill this and receive this' or... 'mine this and receive this'.  Due to there being no storyline you find yourself asking 'why am I even doing this?!'.-: No actual quests, you have a pre-determined set of quests that every player in the entire game is also doing. You have no freedom to do what you want (that is if you want to actually make progress within the game), you MUST complete the assigned quest to move onto the next one.-: The  entire game  is randomly generated making there feel like there's nothing to actually explore, it's just randomly generated terrain and dungeons (that also seem to be very repetitive). -: You must make an account for the game itself, this isn't so bad on its own however it can be very frustrating trying to get your verification code from your email to work (both me and my friend had the problem).-: Character customization itself is bad, (not the hats, there's plenty of those). there aren't many color options, as far as physical traits just about all you can do is change your skin color (e.g. you cannot change your height, width, etc.).-: Things in the tutorial seem to be out of order, for example around my first hour of gameplay I was being being told the buttons used to attack even though I had already killed loads of enemies.-: Does not have very much music.-: All drops are marked as uncommon/rare+ when it comes to the rarity tag of an item, I've never seen a single item marked as 'common'. I feel the game does this to make you feel more accomplished.This game has/had a lot of potential, it really did. Sadly I have to say that I must give this game a 4/10 for the reasons listed above."
Kingpin — Life of Crime,"INTRODUCTION/STORYTitan Souls takes the approach Dark Souls has with its story. It gives you little to no information and rather instead leaves you to sort of generate your own theories about it. This isn't a bad thing at all especially for people like me with ADHD. We easily get lost trying to keep up with stories and often forget important details. If you're looking for a story rich game  stop reading now and go look for something else  because you will be very disappointed. You will need some sort of controller if you wish to stand a chance in Titan Souls. The keyboard controls are pretty bad. GENERAL OVERVIEWTitan Souls is extremely simplistic and follows a pattern that you'll most likely come to love. Every boss is a 1-2 shot kill and you (the player) are also a one shot kill. Unlike many games where you the player may feel you have a huge advantage over the boss or vice versa I feel there's something special about Titan Souls. It may be weird to say but in Titan Souls I always felt I was on an even playing field since there is no progression (you never get any upgrades, throughout the entire game you have the same weapons, stats, etc) I actually came to love this. No BS, Titan Souls is all about skipping the grinding and getting straight to the chase; the bosses. COMBATCombat in TS takes a very interesting approach. You get one arrow which can be brought back to you by holding down the same button you used to fire the arrow. Your arrow will travel distance based on how long you charge it. This gives every shot meaning since whatever you fire you must either chase after or pull back towards you. The con of pulling is it you must stand still, this sounds like a very small thing but in TS this can make some very tricky situations during fights. Most fights come down to a matter of how well you can aim in fast paced situations.PRICE AND PLAY TIMEThe base game took me about three hours to complete. Upon beating the game you unlock a few other modes which can extend your play time but it's still the same game. I purchased this game during the Steam 2016 Summer Sale for about $3.75 and I can say it was definitely worth the price. I would definitely not puchase this game at full price though, I personally think AT MOST this game should be sold for around $10. I highly recommend you download the demo for this game as it gives you a few of the bosses from the game to see how you'll like it. This is the reason I bought TS and I can say the demo was in fact a pretty accurate representation of what the game itself is like."
Tales of Monkey Island Complete Pack: Chapter 2 - The Siege of Spinner Cay,"If I had to describe Shmadow in a few words I'd have to say it's as if bullet hells, endless runners, and sidescrollers had a child. There isn't very much to say about this game but let's talk about it anyway. You're a ball of light who shoots other balls of various colors. Your character and your bullets produce light allowing you to see through the darkness. The more damage you take the less light you produce making it harder to survive. You get get an attack that recharges over a short cooldown and you pickup powerups which can also be used to assist you. You fight bosses and your objective is to make it as far as you can without losing. That's pretty much all there is to say about Shmadow.The GoodOne of the easiest achievement hunts you'll ever see.You can play through the entire game and refund it if you don't enjoy it due to the game being so short.You don't need a controller to do well (I got every achievement using keyboard and mouse).Due to trading cards existing you'll make a large portion of what you spent on the game (if you bought it on sale) back from selling them.Very short soundtrack although it's a very fitting song that doesn't get annoying.Regardless of how much playtime you get it's still only 2 USD.Several difficulties/modes.Really cool bosses.The BadSuper short playtime (15 ish minutes if you're playing normally and 30-90 minutes if you're achievement hunting depending on how good you are at Shmadow). One playthrough of the game is enough for a player to see every boss along with the majority of the content.I like the graphics although I cannot deny that there was very little effort put into them.There's no tutorial although there's a controls section on the main menu.You have to use the powerup to know what it does (they have no titles, just icons) and for a game this short I doubt you want to memorize all of them.If you're poor (and I mean very poor) this game isn't a good choice for you considering the lack of playtime you'll get out of it. If you aren't poor you've got nothing to lose no matter how much playtime you get out of it."
Jewel Quest Pack,Fun Valve classic that challenges your team work skills. This is one of those games that you can meet lots of new friends on. There's lots of replayability especially through the versus mode campaign.
Mahjong Quest Collection,"Basically SR3 2.0.I’ve completed the main story of SR3 three times, I have every achievement and I’ve put in about 160 hours (PS3). That being said I’m having a blast on SR4 even though it uses a replica of Steelport (with some changes such as alien tech).Many people say the super powers ruin the game, this is totally up to you to decide. I love the super powers.. but here’s a few things to note.-	By completing side quests I’ve already unlocked unlimited super sprint stamina and I’m only on what.. the sixth mission? This should be unlocked towards the end of the game.-	I have three of the eight super powers. I can fly/glide/super jump (all one power), super sprint, and shoot freeze blasts. I’m telling you this just so you have an idea of what to expect.-	You’ll probably never rely on vehicles for transportation after a few upgrades on your super sprint, I like this but at the same time I dislike this.I’ve seen many of the old characters make an appearance so far, it brought me some warm memories.Anyways.. so far I’m really enjoying this game. I can’t say you’ll enjoy SR4 as much as the previous games but if you end up enjoying the super powers you’ll have a lot of fun with this game. I got this for 5$ so I’d say this was well worth the money I spent."
"Time Gentlemen, Please! and Ben There, Dan That! Special Edition  Double Pack","Written VersionA Story About My Uncle is a game that presented itself to me as quite promising with its amazing atmosphere which sucked me in from the beginning. I was later led to disappointment as I realized just how little story there actually is and that the game relies on using cliffhangers to keep the player going. I was fine with this until I completed the game and was left quite unsatisfied. The game made me very eager to see just what would happen next as I swung from stage to stage hoping that I'd get some dialogue. The ending left me quite disappointed as I saw the developer could've done much more with the game. A lot of players have trouble with this game (refer to the other reviews for this, mostly the negative). I find that this is what gives players their play time. The developer is asking $13 for a game that could take a player 1-3 hours to complete (depending on just how much they die).-----------------------------------------------------Pro/Con VersionPros- What little dialogue there is can drive your curiosuity enough to keep you playing.- Amazing atmosphere.- Fun gameplay.Cons- Very little dialogue.- 1-3 hours of gameplay.- Monotone narrator/unconvincing voice actors (don't let the narrator's beautiful voice fool you!)- Massive price tag for how long the game is.-----------------------------------------------------Conclusion: I'd say get it on sale, it's a very fun game however its price tag is just quite demanding. For a story based game the story really isn't there; the atmosphere is. You could get something that'll get you more for your buck elsewhere."
"Time Gentlemen, Please! and Ben There, Dan That! Special Edition  Double Pack",One of the best.

World of Zoo,"Alright so this game is, amazing. Alot of people say it copied ARK but you're wrong. Anyways to a review -The game is awesome, so many things to do great with friends, everything you really need. There is a downside though that really hurts the community in AustraliaNo AUS servers. They may be coming soon but at the moment, I go on it regularly just to see if its had an update for AUS servers. I would still recommend picking it up if its on sale (Atleast 25%) and play with friends on a local hosted server.I give it a thumbs up, but if you're in Australia, don't bother unless you are a singeplayer person, stand high ping or if its atleast 50% off.~Hope this helped"
Mini Ninjas,"This game.. Its fricken Amazing. If you want to be the badass, you play this game. Wild Western Themed with Intense gameplay. Your enemies arn't Flies, They're people, you can't just squash them, They go down with a fight. You may think this game is 2ez4u, but trust me, try it, and you will think differently. This game is the one that you come to when there is nothing to play, the MEGA DOWNFALL is that, its community is dead, there is only about 12 people on. I sat on that game, for 20 minutes on computer, and there was not a single player. On PS4 its alive with a community. We just need more players and you will realise that this game is fun, and not some stoopid game that no one plays. We need just 1 thing to push it up to the surface, and reach 100players at the least, so we can show people this game is awesome!                                                 So lets notify our friends, to tell their friends to tell their friends, to get this game.."
Mini Ninjas,"Do you like d*cks? I mean, do you like to survive? Do you have the skills TO survive? If you think you do, Buy this game! Muck around with Creative Servers, Test your skills with PVP servers and survive on survival servers. With tones of gamemodes, its endless fun! Grab some friends, make a team, raid the unraidable, and claim your team the best! This only on rust. For $20.00 its worth every cent, so buy it and kick some d*ck. I mean, butt! Warning: Many Nude Survivors"
Windosill,"Amazing game to play/muck around with your friends. Tones of gamemodes, unlimited things to do, and just great fun!"
Windosill,"This game is AMAZING if you like space, and Terraria! its exactly that.This game is fun Single player and multi player!Fight with your friends to defeat evil penguins! -.-Yes the game is that awesome...Highly reccommended!"
Windosill,"Terraria is a awesome game once you get to know what your doing. $9.99 is a good price since its very popular and fun! People say its like minecraft but really its not. Theres thousands of more things to do in terraria then minecraft. I totally recommen this and you should give it a try! Its got online to play with friends and everything! Theres also thousands of youtube videos to help you! TerrariaHelp And Hero are both very popular on this game! Please, Give terraria a try. All i gotta say is, Brilliant made game!"
Train Simulator: Colton &amp; Northern Route Add-On,"Awesome game, but still has its pros and cons.Pros:Extremely flexibleAlot of things to doOK with friendsA proper zombie survival gameCons:If you have 3+ players on a steam hosted server, bugs such as disconnecting, mouse cursor disappearing etc. will come into effectNot the easiest thing to learn. I had to learn from a youtuber (Kage848)Still alot of room for improvementOverall a great game, but I would wait for a sale (Atleast 25% off) to get it.Hope this helps decide if you want this or not!"
Midnight Mysteries,"This game is amazing! Its nothing like the ' Call Of Duty ' because its more realistic. Great to play with friends. You may think this game is a little bit to easy, because your a *COD player. But no this is 10x harder then expected. Shooting games don't get as realistic as this.All the *CS games have all been good, but this one is more intresting because of the things you can get. 1 Downside of this game is that camos/skins cost alot of money.I really reccommend this game, so if you see it on sale, fricken buy it!! :3* COD - Call Of Duty* CS - Counterstrike"
Midnight Mysteries,Tower defence with rather standard level design and tower design. Levels dont seem very balanced as some require you to sell/build to mess with the pathing of the attackers.Game seems like a bad console port and as I was on my last 2 achievements the game crashed and reset my progress.
Tales of Monkey Island Complete Pack: Chapter 3 - Lair of the Leviathan,"Great concept of a game, Seems to be a perfect mix of chess and warhammer 40k.Although I would not recommend this game as it seems the AI is completely broken, 3/8 missions and the AI couldn't process any moves and the match would freeze.I once had 3 marines with a 95% hit chance attack a single orc and all 3 missed. Misses seem to happen far to often.If the Devs did some work fixing the bugs in this game it would be great but considering these large bugs nearly a year after release I would suggest not buying it unless you only want it for the multiplayer."
Joint Operations: Combined Arms Gold,BEST GAME EVER
Train Simulator: US Loco &amp; Asset Pack,"at the first time playing this game i saw a tank""threw a grenade on the tank""""accidently killed 2-3 friendies""""They said it's okay :))))))))))))))""the next battle i saw a german infantry using a MG42""kills him using my grenade""""stole his MG42, shoots randomly headshoted a random guy""""then i leveled UP""11/10 GG Grenade was too OP for Noobsand the repair cost would be great for a lesson for not using a grenade wayy to much(btw that time i was lvl 0 now i'm not that level)"
DinerTown Tycoon,Yes
Train Simulator: European Loco &amp; Asset Pack,SHUUUNDA!!!
Risen,"Square's Route is a game in which you control a cube within a mostly isometric world.The aim is to navigate throughout each level so that you squish the specified plants. To squish them, you must move over them with the plant's corresponding colour face down on the cube, however every time you move the cube, it will roll, causing the positions of the colours to change. While this may sound simple, it can get very difficult to work out.Square's Route is very well designed, introducing one new feature and challenge at a time, with level design that ensures you understand what is being introduced before you proceed. I never felt too overwhelmed, but it mixed up the gameplay and kept it interesting.Square's route is incredibly cute and full of charm. You should enjoy this game if you enjoy puzzles, planning ahead, and spatial reasoning."
Flora's Fruit Farm,"Think of minesweeper crossed with sudoku.Hexcells Infinite is basically that with a few extra gimmicks added in.When playing, I feel like I'm using sudoku logic, but in a binary way, where each square will be either blue or black.Despite the simplicity of how it looks, this is actually a fairly challenging game.Apparantly you never have to guess on any level, even if it is a procedurally generated one, but sometimes, I'll be looking at the puzzle for a while, oblivious to what I'm supposed to do next.This is a fun game if you enjoy thinking things through logically and enjoy puzzles such as sudoku. I personally enjoy this more than sudoku.As a bonus, completing a level will create a pattern, which is interesting to look at sometimes."
Empire: Total War™ - The Warpath Campaign,"This game is fun with an interesting and unique mechanic that is both fun and rewarding to learn.Often you will find yourself thinking outside of the box while playing each level to reach the exit.The storyline is engaging and entertaining and makes sense in the context of the game. It does not feel like it is forced in at all.You might be worried about replayability, but with the addition of the level creator, the community can now create and share their own levels very easily. This adds seemingly infinite amounts of replayability.If you enjoy puzzles, especially those involving spatial awareness and unique mechanics, you will enjoy Portal 2."
Machinarium,"Fun software to use. Simple to use and fairly effective. I use a low quality and low fps camera (8-9 fps). My lighting conditions are also often far from ideal. Although the conditions are bad, FaceRig does an admirable job of accurately tracking my movements. I have had very few problems with it.While I used FaceRig, I could hardly tell that it was still in Beta.There are also optional fixes for some problems you might encounter that you can enable in the settings if you encounter that problem. (eg. Eyes not opening)If you are thinking of getting FaceRig, you should get it. It is worth every cent."
Machinarium,"After playing this, I found it to be amazing. There is so much to do and they claim that there will be lots more content in future updates. This game is a must have."
Medal of Honor: Airborne,"This game is essentially a maze where things are not as they seem and where it changes with seemingly no reason.As you play more, you will likely start to understand what makes the maze change. You will also acquire ""guns"" which allow you to manipulate some blocks in the maze to aid you.Guns will get better the more you find and allow you to access new areas if you can understand how to use and manipulate it's effects.Simplistic level design and no storyline. Any storyline will be mostly made up by the player.Very little replayability, but there are many different paths and solutions for puzzles leading to those paths that give you a few things to go back and complete.I'd recommend this game if you like mazes and thinking in a way that contradicts logic.This will be a very confusing game for you if you are not prepared."
Need for Speed: Shift,This is a great game. It was worth my money and I have been very satisfied with it. It also has over 15 billion (15 000 000 000) weapons. Be sure to get it.
Torchlight,"I think that this game deserves a lot more attention.I found it a very fun game to play but it all depends on the type of games that you like to play.It has some bugs, but they are looking to patch as much as possible.This game was made by 2 brothers!Do some research on this game to see if it is your thing."
Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 - Uprising,"This is a great game.There are a variety of playable characers and they all have their strengths and weaknesses making the gameplay balanced. There are also updates very often that include new things and fix bugs. This game is also free. The only things that you miss out on by not paying are rarer cosmetic items and weapons with kill counters. You can still get everything else. If you are free to play and have generous friends, it is possible to get these things anyway.You should definitely get this."
The Stronghold Collection,very good
East India Company: Privateer,"Therez suttin' ta be holla'd fo' dis game, n' by extension dis entire series. Put ya mutha♥♥♥♥in choppers up if ya feel dis! It aint nuthin but a game thatz part of tha oldschool breed dat has survived tha decade n' has mostly retained its visceral, gunfighter esque, snappy gameplay wit a underlyin competitve element dat forces tha playa ta outthink hos opponent first n' outreact themt ta a lesser degree. Everyone be a crewplayer, n' if you not, tha magic of dis game is dat it forces you to, fo' a lack of mo' betta lyrics, git phat at it, n' cuz of dat it propels tha user ta try n' stand toe ta toe wit veterans n' freshly smoked up blood alike on a almost punishingly level ground. Y'all KNOW dat ♥♥♥♥, mutha♥♥♥♥a! Counter Strike Source is by far da most thugged-out ghettofab varaint of tha Counter Strike series, fo' tha phat reason dat past tha core elementz of tha game from rescuin hostages ta defusin (or planting) bombs, there be a much mo' user pimped content dat dis game owes its engine like a mutha♥♥♥♥a. This game be a must have, cuz if not fo' tha forever relevent competitizzle scene, itz fo' tha bhop maps, zombie escapes, jail breaks, mini games, n' fo' tha mobilitizzle ta git a game wit hthe Source Engine SDK.It aint nuthin but not a game dat has aethestically kept wit time yo, but its forumla has, n' I bet dat it will outlive even tha juggernautz of tha younger Call of Duty n' Battlefield titles. This be a game of not reqardin tha playa wit trinkets like ♥♥♥♥in freshly smoked up glocks or freshly smoked up faces ta wear yo, but of self satisfaction of whoopin up a entire enemy crew up in a cold-♥♥♥ lil clutch move n' brangin down tha hurt wit a well gots AWP. That runs deep, n' dis game aint NEVER gonna make you forget dat tha only thang seperatin you from acin wit a Deagle n' viewin yo' crew fro ma spectators seat is yo' own skill.

Painkiller: Resurrection,"To commemorate tha beta of Steam Reviews, it only make sense dat I finally write a recommendation fo' a game dat has been close ta mah ♥♥♥ since tha dizzle I was first introduced ta it: Terraria.Terraria has proven ta be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of funk ta play, n' has been one of mah freshest vizzle game time sinks up in recent mutha♥♥♥♥in years cuz of dat ♥♥♥♥. Between lenient system requirements, a solid (albeit imbalanced, at times) combat system, a funky-♥♥♥ broad permittizzle fo' exploration n' a wide selection of buildin decor, itz tha type of game dat strikes me as havin suttin' fo' everyone. Which is good, when you consider dat it also has multiplayer n' ♥♥♥♥. Even mo' betta when you git ta tha late game, which has a wide array of weapons, armors n' tools ta allow fo' a wide variety of specializations.Buildin n' exploration is phat points up in favor of tha game yo, but tha gameplay mechanics is suttin' I'd like ta single up fo' praise. For a 2D game, its combat system has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of spectacle, n' like thatz part of why I find it so charmin yo. Hurtin enemies--even dem playas whoz ♥♥♥ is vastly inferior ta you--feels good. Y'all KNOW dat ♥♥♥♥, mutha♥♥♥♥a! I be fly as a gangbangin' falcon, soarin all up in tha sky dawwwwg! It aint nuthin but satisfyin ta hear tha hit sound on tha mo' squishy enemies, n' peep dem explode tha ♥♥♥♥ into fine lil chunks when they take a thugged-out dirt nap. Ground movement could be mo' betta yo, but certain late game ♥♥♥♥ hit you wit tha mobilitizzle ta dash n' fly, which straight-up expand how tha ♥♥♥♥ you can explore n' fight fo' realz. And wit a wide selection of weapons, every last mutha♥♥♥♥in playa is bound ta find a rosta of tools, spells n' fish-related artillery dat fits they playstyle.Da game aint without flaws, mind yo thugged-out ♥♥♥. With tha gamez update history, tha launch endgame now vastly differs from dat of tha current one. This has hustled ta some balizzle n' progression issues, da most thugged-out glarin of which bein how tha ♥♥♥♥ sluggish tha early game feels. Well shiiiit, it worries me dat tha start of tha game might dissuade some playas from playing, when they might ludd what tha ♥♥♥♥ tha late game has ta offer n' ♥♥♥♥. Da game also has a wack g-thang of recyclin mob AI wit reskins, though dis be averted by adjustin certain parametas n' givin dem unique abilitizzles ta hide tha fact. Even though I have mo' ta say bout tha shortcomings, there be a just too much phat up in tha game ta stay mad bout what tha ♥♥♥♥ effectively boils down ta nitpicking.Plus, it has hats fo' realz. Any game dat has a selection of basebizzle caps gets brownie points.Watch some trailers. Read some other props. If dis be lookin like suttin' you'd be interested in, then take it from me: give Terraria a cold-♥♥♥ lil chance. Da game occasionally goes on sale fo' 75% off, so pick up a gangbangin' four pack fo' yo ♥♥♥ n' three playas. If I be wrong, then I cost you a meal at Subway--not subliminal advertising--and I be sorry as a mutha♥♥♥♥a bout dat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. But if I be right, then it'll be well worth tha price. We sposed ta ♥♥♥♥in pay $60 these minutes fo' a gangbangin' fulfillin gamin experience. This is one that'll run you $10, at most.

SpellForce 2 - Anniversary Edition,"Awesomenauts... one of the best Indie MOBAs I've EVER and I mean EVER played! Not only the graphics, even though 2D they are polished and very nice. The wide range of playeble characters (called Nauts), there is a Naut to suit Anyone. Awesomenauts is basically 2D Dota, Basically. With the Nice cartoon like graphics and a massive online community where you can share ideas for the devs to look at and discuss, share Naut build and since it is a indie game, the developers actually READ the suggestions and therefore making the game a better experience for everyone! I give Aweosmenauts a good 9/10 for the very polished Indie MOBA :DDD"
SpellForce 2 - Anniversary Edition,"In dis game yo ♥♥♥ be a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist whoz ♥♥♥ has never fired a glock up in they game before a round starts, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. Yo ♥♥♥ must help yo' character learn how tha ♥♥♥♥ ta control they glocks while cappin' enemies. Put ya mutha♥♥♥♥in choppers up if ya feel dis! Right back up in yo mutha♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥. Strangely, each character has tha mysterious juice ta fire one or two shots without wack recoil by straight-up briefly jerkin up in tha opposite direction they is movin in. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy ♥♥♥♥♥♥. When yo' character wears a Kevlar vest, every last mutha♥♥♥♥in part of yo' character, except tha head, is made outta steel. Therefore, tha only way ta quickly bust a cap up in playas is ta blast dem up in tha head. Y'all KNOW dat ♥♥♥♥, mutha♥♥♥♥a! This can be buggin at first yo, but yo big-♥♥♥ booty is ghon soon git used ta blastin a lil' small-♥♥♥ smudge of pixels on top of a cold-♥♥♥ lil characterz body. Da Goddess of Guns can materialize glocks up in yo' characterz handz all dem secondz before a round starts, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. But ♥♥♥♥ dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat yo' character must pay fo' tha guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have tha right amount of scrilla, tha Goddess will flash a menu up in yo' characterz eyes, allowin dem ta select tha glocks they want. Mo' advanced playas can make glocks materialize outta thin air wit they mind as long as they have tha right amount of scrilla.Maps is often bout evil terrorists tryin ta take a thugged-out dump on deserted places. Vandalizzle be a straight-up straight-up crime up in tha Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists is deployed ta stop em. Unfortunately fo' tha Terrorists, they is dumb n' only packed one bomb. But ♥♥♥♥ dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat tha Counter-Terrorists do not know how tha ♥♥♥♥ ta pick up a thugged-out dropped bomb, so tha Terrorists can still pick it up afta it is dropped by a gangbangin' fallen playa.In some maps, tha terrorists have kidnapped a janitor n' low-level desk jockey up in a funky-♥♥♥ building. Da Counter-Terrorists done been deployed ta save one, not both, of tha hostages. In reality, dis is just a thinly-veiled excuse fo' tha CTs ta cappin' tha Terrorists while pumpin roundz tha ♥♥♥♥ into tha invincible hostages. One weird thang bout hostage maps is dat you can purchase a ""Hostage Rescue Kit"", which somehow make gives you tha mobilitizzle ta put a grown playa on yo' shouldaz up in a second. Y'all KNOW dat ♥♥♥♥, mutha♥♥♥♥a! Perhaps it aint nuthin but a spell scroll dat allows hostages ta hover ta yo' characterz shoulders. Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive be a surprisingly solid game bout playas wit da most thugged-out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ glock handlin abilitizzles eva peeped on Earth. Even though yo' charactas have tha aimin abilitizzlez of one of mah thugs wit Parkinsons Disease, you have nuff tactical options dat make tha game straight-up funk n' dynamic. It aint nuthin but worth pickin up.ORIGINAL REVIEW BY          DUNCAN DONUTS     http://steamcommunity.com/id/teflon1"
Secret Files: Tunguska,"RUBBISH GAME! DO NOT PLAY, EVEN IF IT IS FREE!ABSOLUTE, UTTER ♥♥♥♥♥!I DINNAE KNOW WHY YOU WOULD PLAY THIS GAME, WHEN IT'S ESSENTIALLY JUSTAN UNREAL TOURNAMENT-ESQUE GAME, WITH ALL THE FUN SPEED REMOVED, ANDARBITRARY LIMITATIONS PLACED ON VISUAL CUSTOMISATION AND WEAPONS."
Rush for Berlin Gold,"Extremely TOXIC (horrible) ""community"", da most thugged-out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I've peeped up in any game, EVER! Yes, worse than tha oldschool Ghetto of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥znit Barrens chat son! I've now played mo' than 64 matches total & also completed every last mutha♥♥♥♥in single hustlin mission n' I've witnessed not just tha other crew but even crewmates comin' at eachother & mah dirty ♥♥♥ verbally before tha pimp selection even starts multiple times. I couldn't give a ♥♥♥♥in shiznit if tha other crew trash talks sometimes yo, but up in a game where crewwork n' communication be a key ta ballin itz detrimenstrual fo' playas on tha same crew whoz ♥♥♥ don't even know eachother ta abuse eachother fo' no reason. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I don't even have enough ""reports"" left fo' dis week, fo'sho, they allot you a lil' small-♥♥♥ number of times you can report playas per week fo' bein punk ♥♥♥ or detrimenstrual ta yo' crew, when up in fact you need nuff mo' ta report all tha ♥♥♥♥♥♥ playas playin dis game.GOOD LUCK if you want phat communication n' crewmork, tha majoritizzle of tha time yo big-♥♥♥ booty is ghon be matched wit playas whoz ♥♥♥ won't rap properly up in chat or won't work as a crew, you gonna gotta end up soloin every last mutha♥♥♥♥in match since yo' crewmates is ghon be ""feeding"" enemy heroes or off bustin whoz ♥♥♥ knows what tha ♥♥♥♥ unless you have yo' own jam of playaz up in yo' faaaaaace!If you aint gots any playaz quein fo' matches wit you I suggest never pickin a support since you gonna NEED ta be soloin 1 vs 5, which is unfair as it is. But tha problems don't end there, since yo ♥♥♥ is bustin all tha work yo' ""teammates"" will EXPECT you ta win tha game fo' them, n' if you take a thugged-out dirtnap they will verbally abuse you & report you or up in fact they might do it anyway just fo' funk at yo' expense!If you only chizzle up in tha options ta ♥♥♥♥ wit Gangsta playas, don't be surprised if noone on yo' randomly selected crew but you speaks Gangsta!, instead it is ghon be Spanish, Turkish, Chinese, Russian & mo' biaaatch! They may even know Gangsta but just chizzle not ta drop a rhyme it, all tha while trash rappin' you up in they own natizzle language.Many times if you rap r crewmates which lane yo ♥♥♥ is takin before tha match starts n' select it on tha map they will insist minutes afta tha match has started dat instead you do what tha ♥♥♥♥ THEY want, fo' example they want you ta put a low on mana SUPPORT pimp by themself up in tha MIDDLE LANE.If you eva notice yo' crewmates ignorin tha chat or bustin thangs together dat may or may not be detrimenstrual ta ballin tha match itz cuz tha majoritizzle of tha time yo big-♥♥♥ booty is ghon be matched wit playas whoz ♥♥♥ know eachother up in real game n' will only rap wit eachother OUTSIDE of tha game, whether by up in person, or voice communication software, instead of communicatin wit you as well inside tha game, so you gonna git NO IDEA what tha ♥♥♥♥ they is planning.Also, fo' tha freshly smoked up playas readin dis review, do not expect ANY help fo' ANYTHING, like askin fo' lyrics or how tha ♥♥♥♥ ta do suttin' from tha playas yo ♥♥♥ is playin with, as you WILL be verbally played & reported (which is suttin' dat seems ta happen often up in dis game whether yo ♥♥♥ is freshly smoked up or not) instead just fo' bein a freshly smoked up playa or any other wack reason, so I suggest bustin ALL tha hustlin missions before you do any real random matchmaking.All dat bein holla'd I do recommend (not highly) dis game afta all if yo ♥♥♥ is playin it wit a crew of playaz & you ludd a highly competitizzle Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) aka real-time game (ARTS) game or you simply wanna use its steam market.ORIGINAL REVEIW BY          Am❤          http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198099901747"

Hammerfight,Great Multiplayer Game :D
SpellForce - Platinum Edition,"This game is amazing, I recommend this game to anyone who plays Tic-Tac-Toe at school and always loses. This game doesn't only provide fun, It also gives the knowledge that I needed to become a Professional Tic-Tac-Toe player. I recommend.10/10 -IGN."
SpellForce - Platinum Edition,"CS:GO is an amazing game, 10/10 I recommend it too anyone who is thinking about buying it."

Massive Assault,BEST GAYM
Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter," <3 This Game! I Love this game so much, its such an action packed game with loads of adventure and depth, I have come across many different vehicles such as walkers, flyers, cars, and even hybrids  (A special vehicle with a mix of two different objects E.g: A plane with legs or a hover with wheels).  Great game overall, cant wait for the future updates to see what else FreeJam has up their sleevs. Overall, this game is definately worth that little bit of space on your computer."
Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter,"Really fun game, played it mulipletimes and never got bored"
Secret Files 2: Puritas Cordis,Great game and amazing graphics.  Get this game or you will be a scrub forever
Dragon Age: Origins,"Great game, i got it s little while ago and it is briliant.  hopefully they lower the game price"
Aztaka,Great game for people that like zombie survival MMO's.  I also enjoy the derpiness of the players
Aztaka,This game will make you feel things
Aztaka,Good
Magnetis,one hell of a fun game...
Magnetis,after waiting a long time after the console launch over a year im glad to say they got the game right. The story is a little bit short but gta online makes up for that. The game runs and looks great so i would recommend this game for sure.
For The Glory: A Europa Universalis Game,this game is great fun!
Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 2,great graphics easy to run does not take away from the original game
LEGO® Star Wars™ - The Complete Saga,great game the attention to detail is amazing which we expect from scs. The game will always be getting better with new updates
Overlord™,Best Game Ever createdwhy?:-Grappling Hook-Unlimited Parachute-Massive Map-Many Vehicles-SPLOSIONS!!!!10/10 Get this game
Overlord™: Raising Hell,"Nether is a terrrible game. the graphics are lower than advertised, there a low amount of servers especially im my area (Australia). making it hard to play with the lag. The game is glitchy i found myself in the air at one point only to fall from the sky and die, vendors bug out and close conversation and no one play this game anymore. I regret bying this game as i bought the gold edition ( which is 20 usd more ) and i wish i could have a refund"
Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars,"On one hand it's definatley the type of free-to-play that tries to ♥♥♥♥♥ money off you, what with the repair system and going straight to the store page on pause, and it can rely on a controller.On the other, the combat is simple but fun, the equips/appearance/setting is suitably ridiculous and you play as a giant who gets to kill even huger giants. I like it."
Yumsters 2: Around the World,i dont no what to say (No Comment)
Yumsters 2: Around the World,"Dayz is a step up from the mod.it runs off it own engine, which does cause delay because of all the bugs.But every update dayz just gets better. from when dayz first came out to today it looks like its not much, but it seems it is becasue it taken the developers ages just to get to this stage. i hope to see dayz be finished by the end of 2016 and i hope the devs do to. but buy the game because it always fun to see a game develop, as your playing you might find a few bugs some might come handy, others not so muchAll credit to Brian Hicks and his team but hands down probably best zombie game if you put aside the bugs."
Command &amp; Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath,The hardest thing about this DLC is overcoming the Bugs on the PC version. Don't Buy waste of $$
Gratuitous Space Battles,"A once great game, much better then PayDay Heist. Unfortunately this game went on a decline about a year after release and has since only got worse. The micro transaction announcement was a disappointing development but one I can't say i'm truly surprised by. This company just isn't the same as it use to be, nor is the game. I'm glad I was around since the beginning for this game and got to play the ""golden"" days of its early release but it just isn't anywhere near as fun or interesting as it use to be."
Gratuitous Space Battles,"What an amazing game, beatiful design, game looks amazing in both black & white and also colour. Great exploration, great weapons everything. Highly recommend."
Gratuitous Space Battles,"Great game worth every cent. Better then Just Cause 3 imo, decent story line and character development. Even at full price it was worth the cost but with the current discounts it's a steal."
Wings of Prey,"I really enjoyed this game, for the price it is totally worth it. If you can get it on special, even better. Fun storytelling, good combat/perk system and I enjoyed the campaign. Plenty of content after you finish the main storyline with extra difficulty settings, arcade mode and duel mode.I highly recommend this to fans of old school shooters and people who enjoyed Painkiller/Far Cry Blood Dragon. If you are someone who expects every game to revolutionize a genre or be breathtaking, this isn't the game for you as this is more about having fun and not taking the game to seriously.Hope you enjoy"
The Bard's Tale,"Very unique original game with a great concept, RTS part of the game lets it down a little but I can live with that. Not the greatest PC port but not the worst i've played either. You really need to be a Metal fan or at least able to listen to that type of music because the whole game is built on music of that genre. It was fun to play a different type of game instead of the usual stuff. At the discounted price you can pick this game up for, you really can't lose. Hope you enjoy it.P.S. The Lore is the best part of the game, make sure you get into the back story as much as possible."
The Bard's Tale,"This is a must have for serious gamers. In my top 20 all time best games, total mind F**k, words can't describe the emotional rollercoaster. Wish more games were like this."
The Bard's Tale,"Great Game.A throw back to old school shooters from the 90's. Been a Wolfenstein fan from childhood.Machine Games has managed to mix modern shooter features with the old for a very convincing experience. Solid story line and character development, Wolfenstein NO brings the FPS genre backs to its roots with fast pace action based around combat intensity, excitement and less hyper realism that has overtaken the entire genre as of late. No more ducking for cover every five seconds to regenerate your health. Wolfenstein NO makes good use of HP and Armour pick ups that allows the player to feel more apart of the story rather than just a bystander.I can't rave enough about the gun play in this game, amazing gun selection and design, almost every weapon can be dual-wielded. A good variety of weapons that all have different uses which help foster and encourage different play styles eg. stealth or open combat. This game has put to rest the argument that every FPS must embrace a multiplayer feature. While I hope due to the success of Wolfenstein NO a standalone multiplayer is developed in the future that echos the Enemy Territory model of earlier Wolfenstein games, this game easily stands tall on its singleplayer features alone.With multiple difficulties, different characters and a meaningful collectibles feature that unlocks four very unique gameplay modes, this game has plenty of replay-ability and could easily be enjoyed for many playthroughs. I don't normally like DLC but I really hope this game gets some side mission or extended story line DLC and fingers crossed a sequel in the coming year or two.Hats off to Machine Games for crafting an enjoyable singleplayer FPS in an era where everyone is obsessed with multiplayer and for standing by their development goals till completion to produce a solid product. Props also to Bethesda for backing a  studio with great talent and vision. Hope you enjoy this game as much as I did."
Defence Alliance 2,"One of the worst PC ports of all time, a truly terrible game. The game is so bad that just having friends come online on Uplay will crash the entire game. This bug has been around since 2012 and still not fixed. If you live in certain regions of the world the online multiplayer is straight up unplayable with terrible host migration. It would of been better off if this game was never made, that is how had it is. Disgusting."
STAR WARS™ - The Force Unleashed™ Ultimate Sith Edition,I really enjoyed this game but the achievement system is bugged. There is input lag on movements which will sometimes lose you a level and hasn't been ported to PC well. Due to these issues I wouldn't recommend this game at the moment but if they patch them and reduce the price I would highly recommend it due to the gameplay and puzzles being very fun and enjoyable.I worthy Hitman puzzle game plagued by issues unrelated to the gameplay. A shame really.
Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition,A great game however the amount of maps and weapons are quite low compared to L4D2. The graphics and evironment are really well made as well as the sound which coresponse to the gun shots. Be it playing with friends or alone with bots brings never ending thrills. 9/10 Must have if you are a fan of zombie games.
Gratuitous Space Battles: The Tribe,"A great massive multi-player game with a very huge workshop base and community market. The game is extremely fun and it is free. Items in the game and many types of gamemodes really brings never ending fun to any player who plays the game. 10/10 one of the best free multi-player games out there. A definate ""Must-play""."
Gratuitous Space Battles: The Tribe,Very detailed gameplay with many quests and great storyline. One of the best single/co-op games on steam. Being able to customize and create your own unique character with a skill tree is definately a plus. Overall a 9.5/10. Highly recommended.
Gratuitous Space Battles: The Tribe,It's awesome!
Build-A-Lot,"10/10 ned flanders simulator 2013. enjoy all the murder and obscenety of ned flanders, before doing anything in this game, ask urself, would ned flanders do this? the answer is yes. the answer is always yes."
Build-A-Lot 2: Town of the Year,"This is a great game, but it ends rather quickly, what would make this game better is additional content and quests, maybe even a workshop. because there are so many ways that this game could expand on it's self, but that's just my opinion. 6/10"
Build-A-Lot 3: Passport to Europe,Didn't pay for this lol.
Coconut Queen,"Amazingly awesome. Would definatly recommend this game. Awesome graphics, gameplay, storyline, and just overall amazingness."
Coconut Queen,"Spawned, zombie hit me, did not know what do to,died from bleedingSpawned again, zombie hit me, now I know how to make rags, killed anywaySpawned, found an axe, now I can kill ze zombies.I got a handcuff without keys.I found a guy and he had a lot of stuff (but he did not see me somehow)I handcuffed him and killed him with the axe while screaming ""HAHAHAHHAHAHHAA""Stole his stuff, left him with his pants on, obviously, and progressed on my adventure.Then a guy shot me in the knee with a bow and he started ""YOU'RE NO LONGER AN ADVENTURER""""I was an adventurer, then I got shot in the knee""9/10, , 10/10 when they add cars"
Roogoo,"It's a great game, but its dead; the only ones who play are high ranked people, If you want to play you better have a group of +8 friends since that way you can make an Inhouse tournament or something, otherwise just buy it for the ♥♥♥♥ of buying GG games, since they're great.Great anime graphics though, Liked those."
Devil May Cry 4,"Jogo divertido e com um belo visual, lembra Pokémon com seus duelos e capturas de criaturas."
Devil May Cry 4,Jogo muito bonito e com uma ótima trilha sonora.
Avencast: Rise of the Mage,"I don't know how I feel about this game. As of now I haven't played very long- but I can say I have enjoyed it.On the one hand it most definitely has some P2W elements, but the starting equipment isn't too bad and it doesnt seem like it takes too long to get up there, and this is coming from a person who fundamentally hates P2W games.The early game is pitted against you, enemies have grenades, tanks, automatic weapons, and all you have is a basic semi-auto rifle. Fortunately I discovered most people in heroes and generals aren't very good and despite the unfair advantages they have over me, I still manage to score reasonably well sometimes.I have only played as an infantry and am rank 5 or so, so dont take this review too seriously.The vehicles are solid and it's good fun to jump on a machine gun while your mate is driving a jeep into a control point. CRACK CRACK CRACK! (the sounds do need some work though.)Gameplay is kind of clunky but no where near dayz or arma2.I would recommend this game simply because it's free. If they made me pay $10 and removed and the pay2win elements, I would accept in an instant. Hell maybe even $20."
Avencast: Rise of the Mage,Great fun: If you like the Hunger Games- you will love this; if you like battle royale- you will love this; if you like competetive survival games- you will jerk off to The Culling's facebook page eagerly awaiting more info.
Avencast: Rise of the Mage,Great experience. Best part is the player vs player interactions. They really balanced out the game so that its not a mindless slaughter (looking at you Nether) But is still a pvp game.The player interactions were good fun (when they are not screaming friendly at the top of their lungs while running away.)But the amount of bugs is almost unforgiveable.Currently I have one where every 5 minutes I get 1-5 fps and can barely move. Buildings get low texture quality and when inside one I cannot see the walls nor floor.Once they fix the bugs- truly a worthwhile experience.
Build-A-Lot 4: Power Source,"This game was really good before they change the layout and how it looks, now it just looks like ♥♥♥♥, when I go into a game I cant hear anything beside some ♥♥♥♥♥ talking and then they had to ♥♥♥♥ it up"
"Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II",be your own jacques cousteau !dive the reef... fun little game
"Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II","Payday 2 is one of those games where you can muck around as much as you want or play as seriously as you want its all to personal preference. Payday is a first-person bank robbing ,meth cooking, painting stealing simulator and its extremely adictive.  With many different hiest to choose from, bank robbing to cocaine dealing you can aproach each mission in any way you like from equiping the heaviest armor and the strongest gun and going loud to rob a bank to going slow and steady in stealth which does come with a experience bonus. The game is very costumisable from choosing your armor, gun, mask all the way down to your melee. But out of the the costumising you will ever do is your mask whcich defines who you are with over 100 mask to choose from and over 100 different colours and patterns no one ever has the same mask.But all up its a very enjoyable game stealth, loud, with or without friends it dosen't matter the circumstances its a great game for those who enjoy co-op strategic shooter i recomend it to all for only 30 dollars its a great pick up.

Farm Frenzy,I did not enjoy this game for the short time that I played it.
Farm Frenzy: Pizza Party,Do not share personal information or engage in witch-hunting. It is a bannable offense. Please report posts that do.
Cake Mania Main Street™,"It sucks that it is free now, but my god it is a brilliant MMOFPSRPG."
Westward® IV: All Aboard,If you own any half life but not this one that is just sad and you are missing out on the beginging.
Westward® IV: All Aboard,Alot of action really thriliing.
Iron Roses,"Pretty good not as fun as the others but still good, make you wanting more."
Iron Roses,2 words friking awesome!!!!!!!!!!!
UFO: Extraterrestrials Gold,An Awesome co-op survival shooter! BUY IT!!!
LEGO® Indiana Jones™ 2: The Adventure Continues,this game is fun and very immersive however there seems to be a massive bug where it gives you several rubble/ blockades to use c4 on but i and others have worked out that it doesn't supply enough c4 for all these also there is next to no where if any to locate more piles of c4.
Super Laser  Racer,This game is 10x better then ISS on steam and did i mention the ftp (Free To Play) aspect is so much better then downloading or buying a game your unsure about.
Super Laser  Racer,great game but to many hackers and duplicators!
Super Laser  Racer,great game but not for noobs!
Hearts of Iron III: Soviet Infantry Pack DLC,"Remember Titan Quest? Grim Dawn is basically a more improved verison of it, so if you enjoyed Titan Quest, you should enjoy Grim Dawn."
NecroVisioN: Lost Company,"From the creators of the show, comes the South Park games.In South Park: The Stick of Truth, you will experience everything that has happened in the show. If you like or enjoy the show, then the game is a must."
Cradle of Persia,"Horrible. Gameplay is rather sluggish, graphics arent too good, and the matchmaking just doesn't want to work like it should do."
Aliens vs. Predator Swarm Map Pack,"Fun game. Think of the game as a more destructive GTA game. In Just Cause 2, there's a lot of things you can do, such as doing the missions (takeover strongholds, complete factions) or just free roam. There are also different collectables throughout the game. I would have to say that the game-play is good, but not great, and the graphics are pretty decent."
Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter,"I do not recommened this game at all. The gameplay is really awful, and the servers are just laggy. To me, it feels like that the game isn't being supported by the developers."
Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter,Este juego csgo es muy bueno me gusta good
Train Simulator: Fort Kent to Eagle Lake Route Add-On,este juego es muy bueno
Mount &amp; Blade: Warband,"Great game for doing anything you want, from spawning in civilians, to building houses and blowing things up. The amount of mods that you can get for this mod is amazing, and never gives the game any dull moments. Definitely recommended!"
Mount &amp; Blade: Warband,"Loved it, drawing my bow for 4 seconds as the enemies emptied their clips into me, reloaded and emptied them again before I fired 1 arrow and missed.8 seconds later and 1 down, thankfully rescued by my teammate we did it all again, I even got a kill that game!With the Javelin, which is pretty badass, just wish there was 5 or 6, instead of 3, seems a bit useless since there are so few.Love the masks! have to say they are the Pro of this DLC."
Coniclysm,"Awesome fun, best online shooter i have played"
Plain Sight," great gunplay, nice alternatives, good stealth play, amazing graphics, cool characters, great voice acting10/10 in my booksoh and SPACE NINJAS"
Plain Sight,"it is a fun game but when you get full ghillie suit,canteen,alice pack,cornfield(infinite food pretty much) the game just sinks, it becomes boring and stupid, Then multiplayer you die loose all your stuff and well, have fun starting over, The developer could have put more thought into the graphics as well. All and all i dont recomend it, it get boring and very repeditive.~thomas the dank engine"
Lead and Gold: Gangs of the Wild West,"Very nice game, easy to learn but hard to master i can tell. I haven't played very long but i can see it has a huge potential. I just wish my computer wasn't forced to 15 FPS while playing. :("
Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City,"Amazing strategy game. Combat works very well and surviving in the wild is hard, just as i imagine it would be in real life. Over a few playthroughs i have frozen to death, died of acute bleeding in the lungs, and of a traumatic brain injury. And if a game has realistic ways of dying then you know its a good strategy game."
Dark Void™ Zero,Join friend's game.Admin myself & kick him.10/10 would kick the host from his own game again.
Dark Void™ Zero,"This game is rubbish, a samurai sword takes just as long to kill them as punching them, I have been riped off by this stupid fn game and the creators should be lined up and shot"
Fortix,"WOW! Just look at my hrs played, I didn't even know I have spent that much time on this game!!! Time well spent! If you have heard it's good that's because it is, If you've heard its bad it is only lacking improvement in those area's, this is an Early Access Game = not finished! If you find something the needs work TELL THE TEAM!!!! They are more than happy to include everyone's ideas. If your still not sold by recommendation from a friend just try it out during the many free to play weekends."
Beat Hazard,"Definitely recommend this game, I mean besides the amazing graphics and hilarious storyline, this game continues to screw with my mind over and over again. Must play~~"
Beat Hazard,"WARNING, DO NOT BUY!!! I don;t know if it's just me but the graphics on this games are just horrible, even when all graphical settings are on high. My beast gaming laptop goes beyond all the system requirements of this game, and (before i get all the hate for using a laptop) I play gta 5 constantly on 50+ FPS fully optimised. So ***WARNING TO ALL LAPTOP OR PC GAMERS: SPORTS GAMES ARE FOR CONSOLES, NOT COMPUTERS*** If you want to buy this game despite all the deserved hate, wait a few months until all the patches and bug fixed are released, please... I made the mistake of buying it on 2nd day of launch, exactly the same to when i pre-ordered arkham knight... (you know how that turned out). "
Beat Hazard,"WARNING!!!!!!: HIGHLY STRATEGIC, HIGHLY ADDICTIVE, HIGHLY FUN."
Sam &amp; Max: The Devil’s Playhouse,Very unique game and VERY addicive

The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom,fun game for pryos
AquaNox 2: Revelation,"Although the long awaited update finally came out and many things from my original review have been fixed/improved, I still can't give this game a thumbs up- Many new SFX have been added and the in game atmosphere (while playing with music off because I don’t really like HM music) has improved dramatically, but the title screen is still quiet. The rain is falling, the lightning is flashing, but it’s all silent. Also, some already existing (but horrible) SFX has been completely dropped out instead of being replaced with better ones. Monsters and skeletons on the first level make no sound at all while walking. You can hear your footsteps but monsters walk silently which looks/""sounds"" really odd.- Keyboard controls are finally fixed, but now the gamepad is not working. Since the keys can’t be reassigned, and the default layout is terrible, the game is (at least for me) unplayable. No gamepad also means sitting in front of my monitor instead on my couch and playing on big screen TV.When at least the gamepad support is fixed I’ll gladly change my review to positive. The game progressed a lot since the original release and is finally (almost) how it should have been from the start. ----Original review:This review is based on the latest version of the game available to me, which is v1.0 for OSX (and I believe it’s also the latest version for Linux). Since the release the developers released a number of patches, Windows only. For a Windows review read somewhere else. I’ll update this as / if game gets updated.From the developers website: ""Slain! is affectionately inspired by games such as Ghosts and Goblins, Altered Beast, Shadow Of The Beast and Golden Axe""Played all of those as a kid. The only thing that's better in Slain! are graphics. Everything else is much, much worse. So sad I backed this on Kickstarter, can't get the refund. If there was only a bug here or there, I would have hope that it can be fixed. But it's not about the bugs here (actually haven't encountered any), it's about poor game design, really bad controls, missing sound effects… In the games mentioned above there was at least some feedback / knock back when you get hit by an enemy, in Slain! enemies walk through you. Sure, all this can be fixed but it’s not a question of days but rather months. At this stage, I would suggest to the developers to slap the “early access” badge on this and take it from there.EDIT #4:As of 31 May developers ""hope"" they'll have OSX (that probably means Linux too) update ”in the near future"". Thanks for the kick in the balls, again. EDIT #3:Hoooraaay! Patch 1 is out! It fixes sooo many things! Oh, wait... it's just for Win. No patch for OSX and Linux. But the store page says the game supports OSX and Linux? Well, it also says there are trading cards and achievements.... but you know, who cares anymore.EDIT #2:Achievements are broken. You can get the first one, but that's it, the rest of them don't work. Store page states ""trading cards"", but they are nonexistent.EDIT #1:Try turning the music off and you’ll find that this game is almost mute!Except from generic footsteps and sword sounds there are no sounds when you pick up power ups, die from spikes, break stones or fall down. On the menu screen you see the rain falling and flashes on the screen (lightning) but can’t hear any of that, it’s all quiet. At the beginning a monster spawns from the ground, blood sprays from the pit, visually very dramatic… no sound… no ground rumbling, no sound of blood spraying, the monster is mute. Fire gargoyles spit fireballs from their mouths… no sound at all.  Monsters make engine revving like sound which starts quietly, then gradually goes louder, then ends abruptly and then starts over in a loop. Skeletons make a fireplace crackling like sound (bones?) but die without making any sound… The list goes on and on. And I’ll remind you all that one of the Kickstarter stretch goals (which WAS reached) was hiring “dedicated professional audio designer”."
AquaNox,"This game is so boring & repetitive, that it hurts. I really tried to like it, it’s got really nice graphics, but it just doesn’t work for me. The story is as if it was taken from a B grade movie, the characters are just plain and soulless, the loot is crap. You visit the same locations over and over again, killing more and more zombies, doing pointless side missions… just boring.And another thing… comparing this to Borderlands… that’s an insult to every Vault Hunter. This is NOTHING like Borderlands."
Fluttabyes,Rather ♥♥♥♥ in my hands and clap than play this.Spent hardly anytime
Fluttabyes,Almir at OVERKILL should follow this route with DLCs
Hidden Expedition: Titanic,"Instead of adding more mercs, fix the already OP and broken mercs"
Hidden Expedition: Amazon,15hrs in and not even 15% through.Worth every cent IMO
Hidden Expedition: Amazon,ok if your thinking of playing this game don't. To kill you need weapons and to get weapons  you need real money and there is nothing yes i said nothing  in the shop you can buy with in game money.... what's the point.This game sucks from there it could of been better if they had  not put everything in the shop for real money....... i rate this game -10/10
Napoleon: Total War™ - Coalition Battle Pack,This game is really good to play with 4 friends if your ready to thift stuff
Fitness Dash™,try it
Gemini Lost™,This game is great but sad
DinerTown Detective Agency™,what more can i add but saying time too get on my unicorn and shoot nana cats while fighting bosses and players!
Hotel Dash™ Suite Success™,This game so far is very fun should get it for fun 4 co-op family night.
Nightshift Legacy: The Jaguar's Eye™,This Game is very addictive and fun to play its cost no more than 0.0 and and is free to play. I give a 10/10
The Nightshift Code™,"Great Game, has a good concept zombie apocalypse and pvp. But it's very unoptimized and at some time unplayable. the devs need to put work into this game. Once 0.60 comes out the game will be a even better game and hopefully people will return backl to this game :)"
TriJinx: A Kristine Kross Mystery™,"d,wa,dkoawdm,awod,mawok"
Valerie Porter and the Scarlet Scandal™,This game really sums our lives as people. We start to lose our imagination as we grow older. The world becomes real not this fantasy world anymore where anything is possible. Great game i would recommend this game to anyone!
Biozone,You should get this game.Nuff said.
Biozone,Great Game!! Bad thing is THERE IS NO CANADIAN FACTIONS!!!!!!!!!!! COME ON!!!!!!!!THEY NEED CANADA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Biozone,"Dayz, what a broken game.It is only fun if you are playing with friends that can take the p*ss out of it, but if you don't have extra money to buy friends, you may want to aviod this.Dayz is poorly optimised, has texture pop in, zombies having the amazing ability to hit you from 100ft away and walk through walls (one of them must be god) and picking the right moment for the game to crash on you.The devs put the servers under maintenance but do f*** all to fix the game. The game is still in early access and will probably stay like that until the real apocalypse happens."
Rocket Knight,"Probably one of the best games of 2016 so far (for me that is). Yes it is a ""walking simulator"", but it was one of the best stories that i have played in years. You really want to engage with Henry as he did certain things that I'm not going to spoil.The art style of the game is amazing. The orange sunset really pop's out and make everything this amazing orange colour (they make good wallpapers).Now, it terms of gameplay, there isn't much. You just walk around the map doing things and walking back to yout tower. That is the only thing I didn't like about Firewatch, Otherwise it is a great game that you should play.9/10."
Rocket Knight,HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥!
Flight of the Icarus,The trailer was cool lol I guess it's k
Flight of the Icarus,Amazing! Well done by Valve to make an amazing casual shooter.
Puzzler World,An oldie but a goodie. Your path is very flexible and has everything an RPG needs.
Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands™ Digital Deluxe Edition,"Team Fortress 2 is a cartoon-like first person shooter. The diversity of classes is amazing while keeping no class overpowered/underpowered. Best free-to-play game out there, better for the P2P's. <3."
Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands™ Digital Deluxe Edition,this game is great 10/10
Ziro,good game

SEGA Mega Drive and Genesis Classics,"really great game a turn-based strategy game. play as rome and becume and empire or  play as lots of other factions. be sparta with the greek state dlc. the game is REALLY ADDICTIVE. i will give this a 9% out of 10%. fyi i am writeing this in 2015 so yeah. you need a good,SUPER or ok computer"
Golden Axe™,"Very great game, original concept and definitely worth the money"
Ecco the Dolphin™,"Took me 70 hours to finish the story, that says something about this game. The DLC's add a lot more gameplay, plus the free DLC. Theres somuch gameplay to it, so many challenges and sidequests. Truly a full game"
Gain Ground™,"This game is literally BL2 in space with lasers and different action skills (With the exception of Clap-Trap), Its very good, would recommend to anyone who likes BL2"
Shinobi™ III: Return of the Ninja Master,"This game is amazing, the graphics, the story, the concept, the environment, it's just beautiful. I rate it 9/10"
Crack Down™,"This game does't have half life 3, therefore it sucks. 0/10 would internet conspiracy again"
VectorMan™,"Played through the game using my foot on the spacebar. Gameplay's too easy, waiting for hard mode dlc."
Shadow Dancer™,You don't own this game? SHAMEFUL DISPRAY!
Space Harrier™ II,"Strongest social commentary on the modern era we live in I've ever seen in a piece of media.10/10, would run over hipsters/'swagsters' all day."
Alpha Protocol™,Its Ok
Alpha Protocol™,It's super smash bros. on PC done right! Buy it now or wait for an access code
Alien Breed: Impact,"This is a very good multiplayer with servers full of many players but with a few bugs, but if you loved single player you would love this!"
Fallout 3 - Point Lookout,"this game, whilst in beta - has all the hallmarks of being a 'spirital successor' to total annihilation or supreme commander.thus far, the only gripe ive had, is having to manually install the DX9 components this game requires - but being its beta, it can only get better from here."
Defense Grid: Resurgence Map Pack 1,good mixture of vrally and mario kart.
Defense Grid: Resurgence Map Pack 1,"Firstly, this is based on the 'early access' release of 11/3/15.We all know carmageddon is the apitomy of 'in your face' games, which includes other titles such as manhunt, thrill kill, gta, postal etc.as of the latest update (and theres been a few in the past few months) - although its in 'early access' the game is nicely playable, the game modes and levels are diverse and varied (although players of the original series will find a few familiar haunts).in its current state - the texture optimization / physic's dont quite run as well as they could, but Im confident stainless will continue working on refining their code to run a bit better (this isnt to say - the physics dont work - they do, and are AWESOME) - however in the games current state, the physics and rendering of additional players seems to tax a system quite intensively. if the quality of the final product can be judged off the current state, I'd say we're in for an excellent ride upon final release."
Fallout 3 - Mothership Zeta,Save yourself the money and dont buy this game
Fallout 3 - Broken Steel,PUCH KILL GET WEAPON
Fallout 3 - The Pitt,AMAZEING GAME :Sans:
Alien Swarm,MAJESTIC SOOOOO MAJESTIC
Fallout 3 - Operation Anchorage,BEST GAME
SimCity™ 4 Deluxe Edition,10/10 would bang
SimCity™ 4 Deluxe Edition,Awesome game sooooooo fun one of the best games I have ever played. Soooooooo much to do thx to zombies and custom zombies =)
Disciples III - Renaissance Steam Special Edition,Hid in tiny toilet at the bottom of a staircase while zombies broke things...11/10 -someone idk
Disciples III - Renaissance Steam Special Edition,Great game I am lagughing so hard after playing i don't even need to spell correctly to find what I'm after or just look for somethig to try so recomend this game
Tidalis,"I may only have 116 hours on rust however maybe only 80-90 hours of that is ""Legacy"" the devs don't like it being called old Rust but I call it old Rust and the real Rust that I fell in love with, they have added some amazing new content in this game recently but after taking out the soul of Rust itself, it really went downhill, I used to get home and spend hours at a time playing this game on the old rust map, it's now that I wish I spent more time playing that beautiful game, now I don't like the look of it, the resource scale is a lot worse and it's just too bare, the old hills on the side of the old road used to be a great place to build a base, not only strategic but it also looked nice, now there's ONLY forests and usually only one stretch of mountains that are too high and bare as the old ones used to have rocks all over to build and hide behind, Facepuch, you made a great game, it still is great what you do but it's just lost it's realism as well, when it looked as real as it did it was amazing, I will continue to play this game as I still do support it but many of us who downrate this game (I believe) is because of the great loss of the old Rust, thank you for reading this anybody who decided to pay attention to this long rant."
Tidalis,No Nazis
Razor2: Hidden Skies,Xp ruined this game
Razor2: Hidden Skies,"I got to make a sword which burned people alive while slicing them up.1000000/10P.s. The game works guts, calm down. You just need to set the compatabiulity settings to allow it to run as administrater. It says so on the Bethesda FAQ's.Good hunting in the wastes :D"
Razor2: Hidden Skies,"In the course of three hours playing this game, I was able to:- Arrest innocent civilians on the streets using hacked security cameras (meant for drug busts)- rank up a high score out of dragon kicking people in the face- Bust up almost every goon mob snooping around-Throw a guy into an aquarium- Sing kareoke like a shnub- Drink energy drinks after a long day of punching people in the face- Learn kung fu- DRESS UP LIKE SHEN ZENG!!!!!In many ways, yes this is eastern GTA, but it keeps things interesting with a (almost) fluid combat system and varied cop/ triad sidequests.Plus as I've already explained (in a way) its a fun game to just ♥♥♥♥ around in.Dragon punched in the face but laughing as you fall/10"
The Settlers 7: Uncharted Land Map Pack,"This game came out only four years ago, and even to this day am I still discovering new quests, dungeons, perks ans items which I never noticed in my first playthrough. Thats what I love about the elder scrolls series (and other bethesda RPG's), in that they are only as deep and as complex as you want them to be, bring with it an infinite amount of playtime hours. Give up as it sucks your life up completely, you cant win!!!!! :D"
Dimensity,"I've played a lot of zombie games in my time, but Killing Floor is by far the most intense. When you have your back to the wall, facing down a Fleshpound and a Scrake, with nothing left but a knife and dead teammates, it really makes your adrenaline kick in. The fact that this game is generally focussed on (but not limited to) multiplayer and teamwork is what makes it that much more enjoyable. Why face hordes of endless flesh-eating creatures alone, when you can share the fun of burning them, blowing them up and hacking them apart with a team? The wide variety of weapons, maps and enemies  really adds to the enjoyment that I got (and continue to get) out of this game."
Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days,Is a brillant game
The Guild II Renaissance,"good graphics, intense gameplay, and most of all......HATS!!!!"
The Guild II Renaissance, 
Hearts of Iron III DLC: German II Spritepack,"""ill just have a quick try"" - me 5 hours ago"
Trainz Simulator DLC: Blue Comet,"I want to figure out the downsides while outlining the positives. This game has lots of action included, its a real challenge but some weapons seem hardly usable in fights. Rockets are good as short burst damage output, but they can be easily dodged and the player usually switches weapons after. Theres hardly any time for sniping, easpecially in relatively small maps,Other than that, the weapon customisation is great and its fun to try out combos. Really gets your heart pumping and the taunts look amazing. 8/10"
Fantasy Wars,"The second day I bought this game , made me crazy. My google search is all about ""BlockLand Add-ons"". I really like this game and like add-ons , its just like gmod :D ( but easier ) BUY IT. BUY IT , NOW! :D"
Mafia II,Most amazing sandbox game EVER!Definitly get this game its a amazing ;)
Train Simulator: Network Southeast Class 47 Loco Add-On,"I got this game expecting about an hour of joy, instead...instead it took over my life..What felt like a couple of minutes became 6 hours.Everything is Hexagon."
Puzzle Quest 2,"One of my Favourite games, keeps me coming back to play more, such immersive gameplay.11/10 would have high latency again."
Puzzle Quest 2,"Great combat, Great building,Great boss fights, Great game."
Burn Zombie Burn!,Can only use 2 races when playing online unless you own the other games...(Otherwise a fun game)

Victoria I Complete,"Everyone is complaining how ♥♥♥♥ this game is. Its really not that bad, in fact it is really good. you guys are all saying that it crashes and it has a million glitches, it has not crashed for me, i play this game on ultra high settings, i get 60fps. dont listen to these other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s writing these reviews. all i can say about this game is, have a more then capable computer, i have a intel i5 4460 processor, windows 8.1 and a gtx 960, this game IS good, just need to fix a few glitches and optimize the game alittle better"

Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Multiplayer Masks Pack,"Fantastic game and the story looks promising, I really enjoyed the first parts of the game. Art is nice and the music really fits the scenery. The only problem I have with the game at the current moment is that the where the text is shown to tell us what the characters is saying is a bit big and one of the pictures shows what I believe is a Ball-Point Pen during the time when the Prine and the Merchant are having a chat after they go downstairs in the Inn. Judging from the current art, this would seem something of medieval time. Apart from that I am looking foward to everything you have to throw at me. =^.^="
Trainz: Classic Cabon City,Awesome game. would tap/10

Super Thunder Blade™,"Fantastic game. Well worth the price of admission, though maybe that's my nostalgia talking."
Super Thunder Blade™,"About 15hrs in and really enjoying it. Party creation was a bit daunting at first, not wanting to miss any core skills etc. but overall is handled well. Solid game, throwback to fallout two, and executed well. Only time wil tell from here, fingers crossed the story arc keeps swinging."

Hacker Evolution,its pre good
Hacker Evolution: Untold,Gave me PTSD 19/45 would die horrifically again
Hacker Evolution: Untold,"When i started playing STO (Star Trek Online) I was brand new to the universe, i had maybe only watched the newest movie, other than that i knew nothing.Since then I have watched every single episode released to air and all of the movies, no game has ever gotten me so engrossed with the lore before, that itself is a testament to the great albeit cheasy writing that the game has.Now to the game itself...It is a very easy to run game and still looks presentable even on minimal settings, the gameplay is a little confusing at first however there are tutorials both in and out of the game that are of great assistance. The story itself follows a character that you create that is a member of one of the three main factions (Federation, Kilingon Empire and Romulan Republic) this gives you access to a large number of humanoid races and the abilty to an extent create your own race. The missions themselves are refreshing and divided into multiple story arcs to make it easier to find a specific mission you may want to repeat.Combat is done in a great way, both space and ground combat is simple yet fun, all three playable classes (Tactical, Engineer, Science) all have defined roles that are easy to understand and easier to play as.Overall STO is a great experience that is in no way P2W, you don't need top tier ships that cost real money to peform well, sure they help but you don't need them. Tier 4 and 5 ships can still be competitive once you hit lvl 50-60 and begin the endgame content."
Faerie Solitaire,"A great game that takes permadeath to a new level but making so much fun, graphics have a nice retro feel that gives the game a great sense of imerrsion along with its great soundtrack.Recentally the free expansion Advanced Edition arrived and gave the players more ships and new mechanics to play with making an already great game even better!To sum it up FTL: Faster Than Light is a great experiance to play and is more than worth the money it costs, i can easily recommend this game to anybody that loves games with an actual challenge and sense of achievement!"
Faerie Solitaire,"Don't get me wrong, ARK is a fun game and it is unique in the fact that your tools include the Dinos and other annimals, however i still can't recommend the game due to the simple fact that the Devs are currently (in my opinion) more focused on adding new features that have bugs associated with them than fixing the ones that are currently in the game. It ruins the experience if your constantly finding bugs that may be small still ruin things or make the game frustrating. Another major concern i have is that you need a pretty damn good rig in order to run this, i can usually run all my games (Steam and non-steam) at their highest settings, ARK however for whatever reason i have severe trouble to run on even its lowest settings. Now i know some of you will go ""Get a better rig"" well that doesn't solve much as it is the job of the Dev team to make the game accessible to as many people as they can, and in order to do that they need to get on top of fixing and optimising the game rather than adding more features. so no i can't reccommend the game IN ITS CURRENT STATE, however if the Dev team is able to address the many issues with this game and do something simmilar to what Space Engineers is doing right now, where the devs arehalting addition of features and are just focusing on fixing the current bugs, then i'd give it a positive review..."
Patrician IV - Steam Special Edition,This game is amazing and it still is only in early access  but yes it does get a bit dull after awhile but hey if we help support the game and give feed back then together we can build this game from a shity house to a villa in Italy
Bonanza Bros.™,"I mess up and everyone dies around meThen killer and I go to Paris to live out the rest of our lives togetherBut one dayThe killer got sick and diedSo me, Dwight Fairfield will become the next killer10/10 Best story line ever"
King's Bounty: Crossworlds,"This game is actually cancer I recommend you go buy something else, its fun for the first 10 minutes then you become depressed because you relised you wasted your money on this"
King's Bounty: Crossworlds,Payday 2 is a great game... if you like games that crash 6 times before you can even start the game and then crashes another 23 times when you are in the game.And when there is a 230mb update it takes 20 minutes to download and a another 3 hours to installConsistency/10
Train Simulator: Green &amp; Gold HST DMU Add-On,This game has one of the bests assassins in gaming history its not just his looks it his powers they arrange from time stopping teleporting and seeing through walls one of the best games ive ever played 10/10
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,"10/10report brazil, Russia and South east Asia for feeding."
Commander: Conquest of the Americas - Colonial Navy,Unbelivably fun.
Serious Sam Classic: The Second Encounter,why get league of legends?
Serious Sam Classic: The Second Encounter,for an incomplete game to provide this much creativity and fun. cant wait for full release .
Star Ruler,the best aspect of the game in my opinion is being dracula himself. you never get tired of running around feeling like a badass. the game does have some negative aspects which completly changes gameplay to the point of it being another game entirely ( i.e sneaking around guards you can never ever kill...). the combat beats gods of war in my opinion.
Star Ruler,"This is a beautiful Game, but if it was co-op it would make it so much more enjoyable."
Blade Kitten,"Awesome game, Looking forward to more content."
Blade Kitten,"A half broken game, that i can't stop playing!"
Alien Breed 2: Assault,"Terrible pc port, terrible frame rates, frustrating mechanics... OVERATED because OMG its GTA are words you can describe this game. After who knows how many year this game is still absolute junk on pc. Good luck as this game was designed for the console peasant industry. Terrible pc optimization and mechanics is something which plague GTA IV. Also you NEED SIGN UP FOR GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE which is to put in words the S.H.I.T.I.E.S.T service ever... EVEN WORSE THEN ORIGIN, to SAVE YOUR GAME. AND on top of that you also need to sign up for some rockstar account to play online. FFS the game is on steam, not like DRM is going to make a difference as steam is an excellent service. PLEASE dont repeat the same S.H.I.T for GTA V. PLEASE NO DRM. Otherwise GTA IV would be a very great game as it already has all the qualities of a great game, just the quality of a crap game aswell"
Darksiders™,"Great all round game, great game for coop aswell. However i find the graphics in this game to be EXTREMLY overated, textures look like a BLUR, and effects are not that good. The map was extremly big, however the terrain was very repetitive, i also find that this game is very poorly optimised, with a Radeon r9 290 i manage to get a meager 50fps on average with all the settings on max. 50 fps is decent, but considering that many games lke crysis 3(possibly even 2), metro last light and battlefield 4 and 3 run much smoother and higher frame rates then far cry 3. "
Darksiders™,"overall a great game for its time, however the graphics are somewhat overated in my opinion.. being the first directx 10 game"
X: Beyond the Frontier,"If you don't like this, then you have no soul.Don't be fooled by the simple graphics, this game has an amazing story to tell and a brilliant soundtrack. Rival's Toy Story 3 for tugging on the heart strings.Wonderful."
X: Beyond the Frontier,"THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING AWFUL. DO NOT BUY.Quite simply, uses GFWL, even on casual mode one simple troop will take a whole magazine to kill, AI is moronically stupid - both friendly and enemies, voice acting is just terrible, interface is designed for console and HUD reflects that. PC graphics are ♥♥♥♥.Not helped by a complete lack of story explanation, completely broken melee and a frustrating cover system. Character models are pretty lousy as well.I REPEAT: SAVE YOUR MONEY. OR AT LEAST SPEND IT ON TRAIN SIMULATOR, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE MORE FUN."
The Kings' Crusade,"Inherently, everything that is good about this game was in the previous two titles that were made by Rocksteady. This game offers very little new content, with half the assassins ending up being overshadowed side mission that don't do the characters justice.The game itself is still quite good, with most of the core mechanics remaining the same. Movements, expecially grappling and gliding are a little off, and the combat (with the City approach of 'more guys = harder) starts to show it's flaws when surrounded by 20+ enemies.Overall, this game still has a very solid core to it, and should definitely be played. Yes, it is the weakest in the series, but that is because the first two were so strong. Some of the elements of this game are nicely done, just pretend multiplayer doesn't exist though. Writing (although I personally did not like the story) is quite nicely done, and everything about this game still holds it's own.The weakest part of this game is that it is the third in a series, and it is definitely a step backwards. If this was a first up game, we would still highlight the flaws but could see the room for improvment. The sad fact is that there have been two games already that have overall been better. But I do encourage you to play this game, because it is still the same engine and gameplay as the first two - and that is still a damn good thing."
Guild Wars: Eye of the North®,"Taking every element from the preivous Runner titles, Runner2 offers an experience that flows wonderfully together. With over 100 levels, dozens of unlockables, lovely visuals and a wonderful soundtrack this game is a really delight to play.The premise is simple: get from one end of the level to the other in a free-flowing smooth run. But this game is not for the people who have slow reactions times or get frustrated easily. It is hard, and quite unforgiving. Repetition is going to happening in this game, but because of the quick reload and charming music, it's hard to feel put out.When you do get a great run going, it's fantastic. All the notes and melodies stiched together with your actions makes it a grand way to know you're doing well. Not to mention that it also helps timing your moments with the logical note progression.Over the multiple different worlds, there are retro levels, multiple paths and different bosses to change things up, and the dastardly combinations of different moments makes you really appreciate the level design - which may appear simplistic at times - but it very finely tuned.This game is great in short bursts for those that don't have much time, it's great for those wanting a challenge, and especially if you like the recognition for seamlessly stringing together your levels and actions. Everything about this game screams that the developer cared about making their game. From the cutscenes narrated by Charles Martinet (who also does the voice for Mario) right down to the charming animations and fluid movement.This game is something you should seriously consider purchasing, playing, loving and then realising that you have to do the whole game on all three difficulties and then all the extras and then costumes and then..."

Age of Wonders Shadow Magic,one of the best in depth stratergy game i have ever played big learning curve but a tone of fun to play so..... GET IT!!!!!
Age of Wonders Shadow Magic,"Now I know everybody loves this game and all that, but I didnt really have a good time with it. Yes, it is probably one of the best co-op zombie games, but I just dont really like it. Theres no real story to it (I guess there shouldnt be) but I personaly think this game is overated. But playing with friends is cool and thats when I only really enjoy it a little bit. Still, not that great. But there are cool features about it, and im pretty sure you love it. 5.5/10. But ill still recommended it to you, cause you'll probs have a ""blast"" with this game."
Age of Wonders,"Funniest game I've played in along time. You really need to play it with a mate and if you just have fun you would say this mod is 10/10, which is for me."
Age of Wonders,"This game is pretty sick, and I've also put 90 well spent hours of my life into this game. Its a game that you keep on wanting more, and more will come! 10/10"
Medal of Honor™,"Not the best shooter, nor will you have the ""funniest"" time you can get out of an FPS. If you’re looking to have fun with mate or just by yourself, play, BF4, COD (Not ghost) or B2. I found that the actual shooters elements of the game is dull. Yeah, you got skyhooks and things around you, which are very handy, but the amount of enemies I had to face was annoying and at times, boring. You also can only have 2 weapons at a time. But what I did like was the power ups, which all had different uses. But for half the game I used like 2 of them, which I think they're is like over 7 or something. So why is this game so good? This game really shines, and is utterly unbeaten, with its engaging storyline. What a story, I never thought a game could engage me and make me care about the characters like this. I kept pushing on the average shooter because of this story. Also, there is a lot of freedom for the play, or as it seems. The graphics is more than good and the city is really awesome to, which you get to explore bits and pieces of the downtown dark alley ways to the wealth and good looking streets, parks, houses and more. So overall, this game is a masterpiece in its own right, and has defiantly set a new started in terms of storytelling games. (P.S. The ending will blow you away and I played most of this game on the PS3)8.5/10"

Nimbus,"I can't describe how much I love this game. There is an amazing amount of polish and balance, from the visuals and the strategic depth, all the way to the raw and dirty visceral depths that combat can descend to.Let me tell you about the combat; It is good. My most memerable battle so far was a 2v2 where I aided a weaker captain vs a bandit, only for a high level bandit to join in.Bandit capital ships are weaker but they have an insane number and reserve of strike craft, which increases by level (not fighters, those are different). My ally engaged the motherships while I thinned the swarm but he was being overwhelmed, so I rammed the strongest enemy and kept thrusting to push him away (ramming is a big mechanic, more on it later). Freed to 1v1, my ally succeeded in destroying the first pirate, but at high cost; his shields down, his nose and two wing modules torn off and floating free, a core destroyed and his health but a sliver. Sensing blood, the swarm of strike craft pounced. There was nothing I could do to save him. He exploded magnificently, destroying many of his attackers who were too slow to flee.The remaining pirate and I circled while exchanging broadsides, each deadly piroette bringing us closer to a field of asteroids. His strongest weapons were on his nose and he fought to bring them to bear. I, meanwhile, was slightly more manoeuverable and clung on the the relative safety of his rear, while picking of the remaining swarm. Our shields failed at the same time.Shields, armour and hull are not just 3 interchangeable stats in SPAZ2. Shields are the most familiar, a flat, regenerating, protective field. Armour is different. Every single non core piece of the motherships have their own armour, some of which is shared to the core. If a part loses all its armour, it is torn off, and sometimes destroyed. Hull, or health is only relevent to the cores of the ship and when that is gone; boom. So unlike other games, it isn't destroy shields>armour>hull with various piercing weapons, it is shields>tear them to pieces or shoot straight for the core.We tore each other to pieces. I took his right wings out but clipped an asteroid at speed, destroying my left. Caught against it, he was able to bring his nose to bear, shreading off my remaining wings and one of my engines. Now he was more manoeuverable.In despairation, I boosted, smaller asteroids tearing into my hull until I placed a large one between us. Frustrated momentarily, he stopped and reloaded. Seizing this last opportunity, I came out of hiding behind him, my last weapons pounding his engine, trying to even the score. But it wasn't enough. He began to turn and rained fire on my last engine. Before I could be left helpless, I once more boosted, this time straight at his exposed engine, knocking it into the void while my nose crumpled and exploded.Both helpless now, no engines, but still he had weapons and he slowly, ever so slowly, turned to bring that hateful nose to bear. With nothing left, I had a moment of inspiration and grabbed the astreroid chunks with my tractor beam. In space, surrounded by the refuse of awesome technology, I beat him to death with a rock.A narrow victory, I collected the refuse of our 4 ships to just bearly rebuild 1, and then jumped to the void.All actions described above REALLY ARE IN THE GAME. If two things collide, they do armour type damage (very weak vs shields, weak vs hull) to eachother based on their mass and speed. If you can get an enemies shields down while yours are still up, boost at him/her, smash their bits off! Beware of ramming with your shields down, as you can wreck yourself. Finally, you can rebuild your mothership WHILE IN COMBAT. A wing came off? Try and grab it before it goes to far, and reattach it! Enemies powerful weapon came off? Remove your own and replace it!Did I mention I love this game?Also, there are so many viable ways of building your mothership, and none are perfect for all situations. I keep parts in storage to swap forms when dealing with different kinds of threats (General flying, starbases, pirates, mining) but my general form is the ION shield ram: Huge shields/thrust and some ION weapons or lasers to take down shields so I can ram them. It is weak to strike craft and starbases however, and is hard to mine with."
Nimbus, Best game I have played on steam. I recommend to evryone how likes shooter games.
Civilization V - Babylon (Nebuchadnezzar II),"Never made a review before so this probably won't be very good, but here goes...Fault Milestone is, at the moment, the best story I have ever read. From the visual masterworks to the beatifully composed audio, the deep character developement to a plot that constantly delivers a fantasticly complelling story. Every little thing is conected in a way that creates an atmosphere of a perfect story.I can't wait for the next chapter!"
DeathSpank,"epic, not as good as Fallout 3, but still a memorable game"
DeathSpank,just non-stop action (if that's wot u want) - brilliant!
DeathSpank,"Great game, but lots of lags and too much money to progress. Fix those two and the game is perfect"
Virtua Fighter™ 2,10/10 Would not buy again-Gamespot
Virtua Fighter™ 2,Super addictive- never gets old!
Columns™ III,"One of the most intense, action packed games ever."
Sword of Vermilion™,Hell yeah!
Golden Axe™ II,"8.5/10! - Action packed and challenging. Although, It would be nice to see multiplayer come into it sooner or later."
Sonic The Hedgehog,"Great game! Would recommend to any people who love survival/horror games like the forest. Here are some key points that I love and hate.Pros:-The game looks great on ultra-Islands are loaded with useful items such as: Palm Trees, Yucca plants (which produce lashings, also known as rope) and more.-Sharks are bloody aggressive since hot fix 0.02.-Ship wrecks are awesome.-Quite realistic.Cons:-As it is in the Pre-Alpha stages (obviously) it lacks content. Even though it is an infinite world, there is only a handful of items avaliable to the players.-Glitches galore!Great game in general though."
Sonic The Hedgehog,It has french people in it. 69/420
Ecco™: The Tides of Time,Its not as good without the Hentai Patch.
Bio-Hazard Battle™,No Bread.
Alien Storm,"Guns of Icarus Online is a First Person Western Shooter that is horrible in every way possible. This game is obviously a failure of a Call of Duty clone. The level up system seems to use unrealistic millitary ranks. I mean, what the ♥♥♥♥ is a ""Powder Monkey?"" You also lack the ability to prestige making replayability nil. The weapons.... Oh dear. You don't even get to hold the guns. They are mounted onto your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vehicle and the aiming is horrible. Most guns don't even have ♥♥♥♥ing iron sights. And here it comes.... the worst part... the ♥♥♥♥ing sniper rifle. You heard me, sniper rifle. There is only one of those in the game and the idiots that made the game called it the ""Mercury Field Gun"" thinking it sounds cool or some ♥♥♥♥. Well it doesn't you filthy hipsters, just admit its mean't to be called the L96A1 Bolt Action Rifle. Oh yeah, I forgot. ITS NOT EVEN BOLT ACTION AND IT ONLY HAS 2 BULLETS. YOU ALSO LACK THE ABILITY TO DO 360 NO SCOPES. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ DEVS LEARN HOW TO MAKE AN ACTUAL GAME!!!Overall I give Guns of ""I-♥♥♥♥ed-your-mother-hard-last-night-carus"" a 420/69 - IGN."

The Ball,My Impressions after playing for 1 Hour so far:+ Great Artwork+ Story is really well told and will keep you engaged+ Great Soundtrack= Music sometimes loops weirdly (Halfway through a song and will loop back to beginning don't know if its a bug or just me)- A few minor typos in the story- Quite a few CG's are just left Black- As far as Im concerned there are no choicesThis game is certainly worth buying for the story and art but just a reminder that this is episode 1 in a series. If there are going to be more episodes of this game it is reccommended that you only buy this on sale.
The Ball,"I caught this on sale for $3 and err.... im stuck with it... Well atleast it has fox people in it. Right??(On a side note, the story and soundtrack is absolutely horrible)"
The Ball,Its like a Michael Bay film. Horrible actors + Loads of explosions. 11/10.

BIT.TRIP BEAT,"Really fun if you like street racing games or a good challenge as this game can provide both. For a game released in 2003 it still stands pretty well today and even has a whole modding communtiy to back it up to keep the game interesting. I find this game to be really replayable as I keep coming back to play the through the game over and over again. Although it may be somewhat short, I find it just adds to the replayability of the game. The racing itself gets pretty fast paced when you get out of the first hub world with features like the burnout, nitrous and wheelies (for bikes) to keep you getting back up to speed pretty quickly. The open-world combined with open checkpoint style races allow for the player to go their own route through the races (or at least to the next checkpoint) or just follow the AI. Because of this, however, most races might require multiple tries to be able to learn the race beforehand and know where you're actually going and to take the optimal route to win. Trying to do these for the first time can sometime prove difficult as the races get longer and checkpoints are spread further out, which is where some of the difficulty comes in. Also that you have to use your current vehicle to beat people who are using vehicles of (most of the time) better performance. This isn't necessarily a complaint from me as the feeling from finally finishing first after many tries is amazing, knowing you can finally move on through the career. My only complaint is the bloody traffic; the most annoying/frustrating part about this game. I don't know if I just have really bad luck or something but it seems everytime a traffic car 'swerves' out of the way it always ends up swerving right into me as I see everyone pass me in that instant. Also when random long busses like to go across intersections right when you happen to be crossing perpendicular to them. But besides that, I absolutely love this game.*ProbablyJustANostalgiaFanaticReview*"
BIT.TRIP BEAT,"Good game, combined best aspects of great ARPGs, d1 2 tl1 2 van helsing1, and with a few new ones of its own. Will be enjoying this one while it grows :)"
BIT.TRIP BEAT,"fun game, people complain about RNG but really who cares, maybe you have to give the level a couple more goes, try something different, eventually you'll beat it."

Front Mission Evolved: Wanzer Pack 2,"Seeing such a great world full of potential in this game. Everything about the game play is great so far. U get to craft, u get to build stuff, and u get to raid and such. But currently this game is ruined by hackers and bad community management. Dun get me wrong, i'm in singapore and almost all the server i've played in has hacker, all the asia server has hacker. all the western server too lag to play. Official server, the name shd make ppl scared to use hack or ♥♥♥♥, but no. there are tons of hackers, ruining the game, u go out, gather resource and get some good gear and suddenly out of nowhere a guy with speed hack flash right infront of u, jerking left,right up and down, and seemingly just smack u to death with a rock, and not once but 4 times. so i said fine, i'll go to other part of the world, bam, aimbots and wall hack shooting from inside a rad town wall. Go to community server? no, admins hacking, admins not bothering about hackers cause they are friend and ♥♥♥♥♥. so unless garry and his team solve this problem, this game is a no go for asian gamers. (Pro Tip: just ban china, they are the major cause for hacking)"
Pound of Ground,"This is a great game. with a single problem that could maby be fixed. the problem is simply because of the way the game seems to generate the levels to match the music is programed to generate levels based on 4:4 timing  (i dont know how to type that the correct way) so if you have something that is in a different time like 3:4 then your may not get a good level, the game does inform you if its not comfident in the timing. granted this may not seem like a major problem but i think if it was fixed it would allow more songs to be played well, and possibly making more people happy with the product. but i give the game 7/10 and if this could be fixed/coded into the game then it would get a 10/10 from me np.PS i know my Grammer is something terribal."
Pat &amp; Mat,Great game i find the systerm designer a bit buggy tho however i would recommend this game to any RTS fan or a fan of games in genreal
Alternativa,Civ 5 is a great game however I think it is best to play with a bunch of freinds in a muiltyplayer match this is because the AI is abit bugged in some ways so I would suggest MP with out a doubtPS:I suck at Spelling
Fish Fillets 2,This is a fantastic game i did not encounter any bugs or glitches and it run extreamly smoothly on my pc and thus i highly recommend this game to anyone that likes a good storyline
Fish Fillets 2,planetside 2 is a great game theres team work masive battles and a veriaty of wepones. the only problem with planetside is that you need good systerm specs to be in thos big battles unless you love lag.PS I RECOMEND YOU HAVE A MICROPHONE
Archon Classic,THIS IS A GREAT GAME with elements of an fps great transport ground and air a mech 3 awesome classes lots of amazing weapons and the augmentations makes it that much better if you like a.Shooting things. b.Dinos or c.defending things this is the game for you. :D
Archon Classic,great game must get
Call of Duty®: Black Ops,this game is a good game for pepole that like first person shooters i give it 5 stars
Rhythm Zone Tornado Visualizer DLC,"An FPS that is somewhat Rogue-like. Some glaring issues with multiplayer, and a not-quite-right balance to the quality of loot, when I played it originally at least, lead me to pass it off as not great.Playing some co-op recently it was still passable."
Rhythm Zone Tornado Visualizer DLC,"A solid puzzle game with a strong, albeit wierd, theme.No replay value."
Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,"For a game that resets and randomises everytime you play, it has a suprising amount of persistence and skill.The items you find make for very different attempts and the sheer number and variety is great. Over several tries you get further and further as you learn the patterns to defeat each enemy, while also earning achievements that add more items to possibly spawn or unique characters to play as.A fantastic game that I highly recommend on the provision that you watch the trailer for it. The theme is well done, but not for everyone."
Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,"If you play this sandbox explosion-simulator you will clear 3 main story missions, then get distracted by stronghold attacks and the addiction to completely clear every village or military base you come across. This is not a bad thing.An excellent game for when you want to play something and get a sense of accomplishment but don't want to spend hours."
Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,"This is the best currently available Mech game for the PC that I know of. If you are a fan of the customisable-robot shooter genre and can't wait for the release of Hawken or Mechwarrior Online, then this is a solid game. But not the multiplayer. The Co-op survival DLC is fun, but limited to 2player, the standard online is rubbish."
Rhythm Zone DJ Table Visualizer DLC,"I don't recommend this game.For a game that lets you flip which direction gravity works in you'd expect there to be good puzzles. Instead there's some okay ones every now and then, and the majority of the game is mediocre platforming made frustrating as the fall height for ""falling to death"" is barely more than your jump."
Rhythm Zone DJ Table Visualizer DLC,"A solid rogue-like with a huge range of character types to mess around with. It can take more than a few tries to find a build that works, and to learn the tricks to each level of the dungeon but there's some real satisfaction in getting past your last death."
Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD,"An excellent platforming shooter. Good artwork, soundtrack and plot, and good pacing, mixed with a broad spread of weapons with no obvious ""best"" pairing. The 3/4 viewpoint does take some getting used to, and you do get used to it, expect to fall off a lot of cliffs until you do."
Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD,A class-based top-down Left 4 Dead that's completely free to play. If you're looking for a game for 3-4 people to play together (or 2 very stubborn/skilled players) then this is worth a look.
Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD,"""Stay in the light, don't be seen, don't listen to the voices, stay in the LIGHT, don't look at the cor- no nononono! Don't be seen, don't make any noise, don't look at the..."""

Lara Croft GoL: Raziel and Kain Character Pack,Terraria is endless amounts of fun and no matter how many times I play this game I experience it differently every time. I recommend this game to all sandbox game lovers as it has a massive amount of items for you to find and use as you wish. Terraria is an amazing buy for any lucky b stard that picks it up. :D
Lara Croft GoL: Things that Go Boom - Challenge Pack 2,amazing yup zxc
Lara Croft GoL: Things that Go Boom - Challenge Pack 2,Pass The Whiskey.Whiskey/10
Lara Croft GoL: Hazardous Reunion - Challenge Pack 3,Disturbing but addictive with endless great replayability.
Lara Croft GoL: Hazardous Reunion - Challenge Pack 3,haven't played any other assassin's creed games but from what i've heard this is the best. it may be old but it's such a fun game to run around italy assassinating people who deserve it with those really cool hidden blades.
Lara Croft GoL: All the Trappings - Challenge Pack 1,"not as scary as the original amnesia, solely on the fact there is only a single type of monster chasing you discluding the other variant of 'it' towards the end of the gamebut i wont lie, encountering the beast for the first time definitely added an hour to my gameplay"
Lara Croft GoL: All the Trappings - Challenge Pack 1,"hello and welcome to the hat-skin simulator! if you played this game before july 2 2015, you may have been aware of the countless cosmetic items you could buy in team fortress 2 to waste your time equipping and trading (exactly 1248 cosmetics right now to be exact). if you got sick and tired of all these cosmetics that partially kill the game, well now there are skins! that's right! now these even more stuff to stop people from actually playing the game!because let's face it this game may be free but it sucks your wallet like a dehydrated catfish.csgo/10"
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City,"this game is essentially another one of those idle mass money earning games, or you can call it a 'cookie clicker clone' if you like. personally i found it fun competing with my friends to see who can earn money the fastest but i can easily see that it could get boring very quickly for impatient players.if you want to 'speed up' the process without giving up actual physical money for jack ♥♥♥♥ in this game, there is always the option to travel to the future with the use of your computers clock..."

Zeit²,"there's something just so oddly fun about playing extremely old games for me. although this game can be a bit challenging, it's just so enjoyable."
A.R.E.S.: Extinction Agenda,"this is by far the greatest rpg i have played since 2011. there is tons of stuff and places to explore and discover in skyrim which makes the game so enjoyable for such a long time. theres also something so satisfying about luring a giant in such a long trek up a mountain and then shouting all the way back down.it also has the most amazing quote to ever exist in a game:bandit - ""DIE! SO I CAN TAKE YOUR STUFF!!1!""i have never wanted to just lay down and die in front of my enemy"
A.R.E.S.: Extinction Agenda,pewdiepie played this game first♥♥♥♥ off
APOX,"it's free to play and it doesn't include paying to win mainly because the game is based on PvE, but still includes PvP and it has a ♥♥♥♥ ton of stuff to buy and level up.why is leveling stuff so fun?why am i still playing this game?"
APOX,it's free and pretty fun to play with friendsbut mainly just to get a hat in a simulator
APOX,this game has had me hooked for over 4 years and im still not bored
Dead Space™ 2,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FROM STEAM. If you do, you'll be at Steam's mercy, likely to waste a lot of money on an inactive game like I just did. This integration is the worst I have ever seen, and although you probably won't notice any problems at first, you will, eventually."
Drawn®: The Painted Tower,"It's like Minecraft in space. But unlike all the other Minecraft-in-spaces, it's actually good. It's incredible, really, everything has its own physics, everything is infinitely destructible, and it's very playable and addictive even with its basic gameplay! I haven't even gone outside creative mode, it's so much fun to make your own fleets in preparation for the eventual future warfare that may happen in multiplayer. Huge drain of resources, though, the large constructions I've been working on bring my GTX 770 and i7 4770k to their knees."
Drawn®: The Painted Tower,BUY THIS GAME

Sonic The Hedgehog 2,First Review
Sonic The Hedgehog 2,"this is a great game that really made me think ( i tend to think too deeply about stuff tho) and even thought its me most moral based games result in me cutting up the ""insert maids name here or bad choice option"" but this made me really think and i loved all 27 min and 33 secands of it"
Streets of Rage,"one word ""amazing"""
Shining Force II,"behold THIS AMAZING demo of ""what starforge could have actully have been"" is just a tast of this product and only represents 0.0001 of the actural product promised you can either A leave with your money knowing RUN RUN RUN ITS A VAPAR WERE or buy it and then complaim to steam support taht you purchest this wondefull fine game and recieved the demo only to learn it was the full deal and that there is barely anygame to playcough warz cough cough"
Shining Force,"A very well done Td game, with a unique taste and art only worth the buy however if you wish to support the developers on there other games as kingdom rush is free online with a few features missing but more or less the same."
The Sims™ 3,For those who DID enjoy Sid miers CIV 5 then Endless legend gives a fresh breath to the 4x genre where each faction actually has notable advantages and disadvantages where CIV 5 was strongly lacking
Ship Simulator Extremes: Sigita Pack,"Amazing game, Amazing graphics but to those who lack a steering wheel good luck :D"
The Sims™ 3 Fast Lane Stuff,"♥♥♥♥ing zoom zoom, I think straight up if you're looking for whether or not this game is worth is soley dependent on if you enjoy casual games this game offers a somewhat medium to high range replayability, after completeing all the objectives the games difficulty definetely rises between each region so expect for alot of crashes and thats not even an understatement, so buy it if it's on sale definetely otherwise its simply whether you enjoy fast paced games"
The Sims™ 3 World Adventures,A very punishing yet rewarding game only 2 difficulties very easy or easy don't be fooled however as the difficulty ramps up very quickly.
The Sims™ 3 Late Night,"Complete Bias RWBY FAN, Giving the Game a thumbs up :D"
The Sims™ 3 Ambitions,An amazingly well done Benchmarker definitely a worthwhile add to user whom really want to know what there getting out of there PC

Test Drive Unlimited 2,"This game is the definition of awesome dont get the other Dow 2's just this one, standalone, This is the S**t, I promise you buying this will show you the face of God"
King Arthur: The Druids,"One of the best games I have ever played.However it is not for everyone, here's why.So Hyper Light Drifter follows a charecter called ""The Drifter"" or ""The Magician"", a blue skinned guy who has a kickass sword and can dash and kills stuff! The story for the most part is hard to follow if you dont pay attention and because there is no dialogue it isn't dropped in sort of easy to pick up hints. Instead when you talk to people you are shown still images that tell a short tale. From what I can tell the story is ""You're part of a race called Blue-Skins, who did some bad ♥♥♥♥ and are hated. You are approached by Anubis/The Jackal who is supposed to be god, he asks your help to fight an evil called Judgement, the Jackal makes sure you do this by giving you a disease that will kill you unless you help him seek out and destroy Judgement!""Tl:dr You're a smurf who needs to help a dog god kill a big black thing, also you've got cancer.The game itself has a lot of big pro's and con's that will likely affect your decision on buying itPro-Amazing art style-Amazing music-Difficult gameplay-NG+-No dialogue-Pretty cheap price when on sale-A few difficult achievments to work towards-Makes you want more high quality gamesCon -No Dialogue-Sometimes unfair and a bit frustrating-Only one story or way to play the story-Pretty short game-Makes you want more high quality games-Capped at 30 fpsSo I put some stuff in both Pro and Con, I doubt I have to explain why but I will just in case.Stuff like no dialogue are both good and bad, depends on the point of view.Anyway my final review of this is  8/10 Gameplay  6/10 story 3/10 replayability  7/10 Overall  Like Dark souls and Zelda violently ♥♥♥♥ing behind a bar "
Gratuitous Space Battles: Galactic Conquest,Found a dragonKilled a dragonFound a citySlaughtered the cityForgot to save before slaughtering cityLearnt from my mistakesSaved gameslaughtered city10/10 Would kill thousands again

It was so good and the following is just as good, the only con is that the game does not have an infinite story"
DUNGEONS - Steam Special Edition,"So since Overkill now fully owns Payday 2, I feel I have to re-write this.I have yet to play a new ""Fully Overkill"" game of Payday 2 yet but what I have already seen from their announcements, I am pretty excited!So they made all future safes free to open,have a Skills beta that they are working on and they have said they promise 18 months of continued support. To me this seems like a big step in the right direction and I am happy to reinstall the game and play more if it helps Overkill return to their former glory."
AI War: Light of the Spire,"Eh, not bad."
AI War: Light of the Spire,"Where to start? This game, is nuts! I am a GIANT clicker fan, starting with cookie clicker, to Adventure Capatalist (of what is more of an Idle game) to Clicker Heroes! But this clicker is my favourite.  Here's why.1. It has AIMING! As with all bland games, aiming makes things better! Such as my favourite MMO of all time, Wildstar.So when this clicker had aiming I knew it was worth a ""Shot"". (Yes, that was a pun).2. It was based on one of the coolest games in the VR Universe, Time Rifters. To be based in the same scenery is a lovely trip to your brains memory compartment, if you haven't seen that game, then it's just a cool place to be in general.3. Its got great progression! Not at one point did I feel It was going too fast or too slow, and when I needed money the most, a Rainbow Money Ball would come along and help me out!So in total this is the greatest Clicker/Idle/Shooter of all time! If you are not sure, give it a try!"
Drakensang: The River of Time,"Buy this game, Just do it. Don't let it's primitive graphics fool you, This is one tasty dungeon crawler, and a one of a kind too.  There just isn't a game better to show you into an unknown enviroment, with lurking monsters and the looming sense of danger. The sound is amazing, the graphics are good enough and the gameplay is sweet! I reccomend you play with headphones and at night for a better experience."
RISK™: Factions," I love it, if your not sure, try it. When I started I was a bit Eeeeeh, But that intro, that starting area filled me with awe and adventure and I set off, I barley scratched the suface with my 400 or so hours from just having fun and exploring, theres so much to do, and classes? Pfffft no more, do what you want, be free."
Crazy Machines 2: Time Travel Add-On,"I reccomend it! I got it when it was $55 and I still don't regret it. I didn't like the DS ones but this one takes the DELICOUS MASSIVE CAKE! But let's talk detail.This game is literally a dictionary stuffed inside cartoon graphics and zapped with story, and I'm okay with that. The story isn't half bad, the level design is fabulous and the graphics is eye candy. There are afew flaws, some times words entered aren't adapted and it won't help you spell your workshop creations (I happen to have made afew) so it can be a little tedious when trying to make somthing specific. Don't make somthing specific! Go nuts! I come back to it even with the story complete just to make some crazy stuff. (P.S That backpack is very useful if you like making special items every time you play!)"
Crazy Machines 2: Time Travel Add-On,"A good game, a GREAT one at that. You ever wanted to do parkour? Be a Ninja? and shoot GOD DAMN LASERS!? Well now you can in what I call ""Laser Ninja of Death Remix Party: The Game"". In all honesty the combat is fluid, when I say that I mean their arms fall of and leak fluid everywhere, the parkour is a joy but the camera takes some time to get used to, A great game, if only those platnium transactions wern't there... Oh well."
BIT.TRIP RUNNER,"It's an old game indeed it is, but a great one, a gem at that! It's a steam must have and it was a revolution to the sandbox genre. GMOD is a versatile sandbox that you can tweak the very physics of objects and change them however! I like creating slingshots, hovercars, cars you can't drive because they're way to fast... and hey! You can even put faces on melons! This game can get a little buggy, but all bugs here are halarious! and if you have friends to play with, your in for one hell of a treat!"
BIT.TRIP RUNNER,"A game similar to cookie clicker that has more features and mechanics! In detail you start squeezing some lemons to building a vast oil rig, the goal is simply to gain as much money as possible, Im playing it as I write this as I hired managers to play while I'm not even there! This game was on Kongregate and I like it there and even better here! Try it out, it's free! I reccomend it. Plus, it made it to the ""Most Popular"" 1st page in 3 days, it's done somthing right!"
Homefront,"A game with nine classes, with different weapons and styles. This is what call of duty didn't do, and Valve said ""Hey, that call of duty 'aint doin' it right, this is how it's done!"" and sugar coated it with sweet graphics and dynamic lightning. Just a peice of goodness that you don't want to miss out on! Plus, it's free."
Fate of the World,"A peculiar yet facinating game where you play as somone who you think might be on drugs, might be obsessed, but definatly belongs in an asylum."
Fate of the World,"An insane and cheap rage experience. It's like a rave and school start curb-stomping you on the street, or if santa and the easter bunny could throw up cornchips and neopolitan icecream. Never again will you hate Hexagons and other polygons so much."
Fate of the World,wont work it kepps crashing
Fate of the World,"Very disappointing. Codemasters have taken a grant-bribe from Oculus to buy platform exclusivity. No reason this couldn't have been delivered using open source Steam VR. Codies' PR team are busy fobbing off questions about Vive compatibility with evasive corporatespeak drivel while, presumably, lighting Cuban cigars with dirty $100 notes from the Facebook coffers. What next? Games you can't play with mouse/keyboard control unless you're a Logitech customer? nVidia only software which refuses to run for AMD users? Software which only works on a Samsung monitor (thanks for the brown paper envelope, guys).It sucks, and is of no benefit to the consumer. The PC platform's strength is broad compatibility regardless of who manufactures the components or peripherals. This is the thin end of the wedge, and PC gamers should stand together in giving a well deserved collective middle finger to anyone involved in these shabby practices.Oh, and as far as the review goes, I couldn't play the game in VR because Codemasters were bribed into avoiding the de facto OpenVR standard in favour of locking down the hardware with Oculus' proprietory drivers, so....That's a huge thumbs down and a generous 2 testicles/10 rating for this one. Hope Codemasters choke on Mark Zuckerberg's baby batter..."

Darkest Hour: A Hearts of Iron Game,I want a game that runs.... thats not this game... rockstar social club is the internet explorer of game clients (and thats being generous).
Dungeons: Into the Dark DLC Pack,"Sacred 2 is one big GAME! I'm telling you, if you like big games with tons and i mean tons of quests and exploration then this game is for you :) I spent 90 hours on my ps3 playthrough and only explored 35% of the map. Like, WOW! There are hundrends and i mean hundreds of quests. I'm not sure on the max player level but i got to 127 over the spand of 90 hours. The game might not be as polished as DIablo but i tell you. It is wayyy more fun. As far as the game goes it's 10/10 Don't expect anything serious because the story is crap and quests are not the greatest. But it is an amazing game."
Dungeons: Into the Dark DLC Pack,"Fallen Earth is a very fun and unique game, it has a lot of features such as mining rocks and scavaging in rubbish piles...with the copper you mine from rocks you can craft into bullets. You can also  lvl up  geometry skill which will allow you to mine higher lvl rocks and get more resorces from them, as far as pvp goes i have yet to try it out. I find that melee is a good skill to start lvling up right away because it can become handy later on, also the quest system is nice filled with different varieties and you never feel as if you have done the same quest more that twice.The map is HUGE and would take hours to explore and going out past a certain point you will find that enemies will get tougher very quickly which will force you to lvl up before exploring more which is good because when you die from a hard enemy and then go lvl up a little bit when you go back to that same enemy you feel like you are getting stronger and making progress towards you'r character. I very much enjoy a few hours a day of fallen earth and would easily give it an 8/10 for mmo standards. I have not seen many fps open world mmorpg's around and this is quite the package if you are looking for a game like this."
Dino D-Day,I don't even know why is spent 400 hours in this game. The most fun i has was playing on a server with no players and killing zombies whilst collecting loot. The pvp is horrible and it's buggy as all hell. DO not buy this game! Buy Rust or DayZ instead.
Dino D-Day,Great game with tons of stuff of to do an awesome addicting weapons customization. The gunplay feels wayy better and killing raiders is oddly satisfying :P I can't wait to see what they do with future dlc's. Despite a few issues on the PC version i would so far give this game an 8/10. Story isn't great but exploring the wasteland and gathering resorces for your base and new upgrades to armor or weapons is extremly fun.
Patrician IV: Rise of a Dynasty,I bought this thinking i would have access to all online areas as it states. But once i bought it and launched the game. It didn't do anything. What a waste of money.
Portal 2,If Diablo had raids.
Portal 2,Very fun game
Magicka: Vietnam,"Blood Bowl 2 is a very fun but RNG heavy strategy game. Since all decisions are made through simulated dice rolls, it can be as merciless as any wargame/tabletop.That being said; if you can stomach a sometimes clunky interface and the notion that sometimes you just WON'T win some matches due to dice rolling, Blood Bowl 2 is a great game. There is something incredibly satisfying when you knock down an enemy player's unit and injure or kill them."
Magicka: Vietnam,Great game overall that focauses on teamwork.
Sanctum,I have played many a frustrating hour solving the puzzles this game puts up. And yet! I keep coming back to it.
Sanctum,"At first Play I am impressed, great movement, good graphics and gameplay 4 stars"
Sanctum,Takes a bit of time but the work is worth it. A highly underrated Flight simulator and at a great price too.

Dungeon Siege III,"Well what can I say, really? For a game that's in its alpha stage development I have never loved any game so much. Despite the fact that I can see this game having a lot more features and fixes added into it (I started playing recently in Alpha 10.4), in my oppinion its so far very in my oppinion realistic when it comes to survival, and very addictive; you are just dying to get the game right when you first try it out. For those of you who posted negative feedback on 7 Days to Die, I have got no idea what you're crying about, because this game just blew me away! I fully reccomend this game to anyone who is interested!"
Dungeon Siege III,"Quite possibly one of my favourite games ever, Saint's Row III is serious about messing around.Aim of the game: shoot stuff, chainsaw stuff, explode stuff, run around naked while hitting stuff with a ♥♥♥♥♥/baseball bat.The possibilities are endless. Regardless of how many times the game glitched on me or just plain disturbed me I couldn't stay away. The fast paced combination of shooting, running, driving, flying, skydiving in a panda suit with a chainsaw, I just couldn't resist the simple, mindless fun of it all.Screwing around in sandbox mode is certainly more exciting than a mojority of the story and that's OK because the game is simply incredible.Flawed and Unfaithful to the previous games as SR3 is, it is still a brilliant game and totally worth your money.SO BUY IT."
Duke Nukem Forever,"This game is a great Top Down Zombie Shooter, with lots of references to other games, lots of things to do and hours and hours of fun. It's greatly addictive and you won't stop playing til you're tired."
A.V.A. Alliance of Valiant Arms™,"Where to start. Well I'm in it so it's guaranteed to be epic. All jokes aside though the game is awesome, and you can read my review to know more.The game overall is awesome, it's like borderlands 2, but it's better. The Scaling in BL2, was horrible from level 50 upwards. You need OP and Gamebreaking gear to get anywhere in the game fomr UVHM onwards. And I can already see the scaling in this game is a lot better. I'm able to now use Purple guns to defeat a raid boss, solo. The visuals, can be a little repetitive at times, but overall they are appealing and does bring different environments into the game. Now as for gameplay, well, many, including me who had seen the gameplay, thought that the butt-stomp ability would be a gimmick in the game that I would never use. I was wrong. It adds so much more to the combat, in addition with the low gravity, killing is a lot more fluid, getting around on foot isn't so boresome, and depending on how you use your ""double jump"", and where you activate the extra boost, gives completely different outcomes. For example, if I need to get to a higher ledge, a jump and boost when i'm halfway until the fulcrum of my jump, giving me a way higher jump. But If I was to say get passed a very wide crevice I would start sprinting, jump then activate the boost before I start descending. And this all may seem simple, but it can be applied to the combat maneuvres and it overall makes combat more pleasing. I particularly like to use the second descripted type of jump a lot when traversing without a vehicle, it practically triples my movement time and comes in handy, even in the normal gravity environments, such as Helios.Now for Classes. Of course everyone started the game as claptrap, so i'm going to go and do something different like I usually do, I played the game as Nisha, speccing into her middle and right trees, and found myself being basically a god, maybe here is where the teamwork really comes into play. Having all 4 Nisha's running around wouldn't work, because you have no way of healing or buffing teammates. Nisha is a very combat centred solo class. And I would say she is needed for every kind of boss fight, she deals damage and deals it where it matters. Claptrap, is a must have, he gives the team random buffs, and helps out alot with co-op, lots of health boosts, dmg boosts etc. Athena plays the role of the tank healer, she is a great class to play as with friends, although solo not so much. Her abilities are a lot like Maya's except she soaks up damage. She is also a vital part to the team, giving out lots of Health regen. I didn't play wilhelm much, but from what I did, He is just a straight up tank class. He takes all of the damage dealt while dealing a fair enough amount of damage. He is the most Balanced class from what i've played of him but isn't very fun (for lack of better term), So overall the classes have their own Pros and cons and they all do their own special thing that makes them vital to the team.As an overall, I'd say the game does use lots of content from Borderlands 2, including some legendaries and renamed Unique guns. The humour is a step up from Borderlands 2 and as an Australian I did get all of the jokes, so that could be a downside for some players who don't know much of Australian slang and colloquialism. But yes, the humour is well done and implemented, the story is EXCELLENT. I love it. *No spoilers* I hate lilith for what she did to jack, and I empathised for Jack as the hours passed. Some of the negative reviews here state that the campaign didn't give enough XP to get to the required levels, but that's because they didn't do the side missions, which were frankly better this time around. There is a lot more variety and SO MUCH story to be told in the side missions, like how Terramorphous made it onto Pandora, when Threshers where only a Moon Species (DAMN YOU HAMMERLOCK), or how Jack comes up with the idea of Moonshotting loaders to Pandora etc. Lots of things storywise are excellent, with a nice twist on Jack at the end and how he gets the scar on his face. The story just blew my mind the first time around, and I stuck around long enough for 3 more playthroughs up to TVHM and still find it enjoyable. I especially can't wait for the UVHM pack that will have a new Narrative Voice over along with Tiny Tina. Overall Game was excellent.Now for a short list of Pros and Cons incase you don't want to read all that garbage.Pros:- Story- Classes- Visuals- Soundtrack- Gameplay- Combat- Low Gravity- Enemy Scaling- Weapon Scaling- Replayability (I'd die if I didn't put that in there)Cons:- Nisha and Claptrap are the only 2 classes that are really enjoyable in SP and MP- Wilhelm and Athena lack enough SP Skills to play SP, but are both great for MP- Not as many legendaries- Maybe too many reused Borderlands 2 Assets- Comedy can get a little dry after a whileAnyway that's my Review of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel I give this game an overall of:8.7/10. It's more of the same which isn't bad, it still has that Borderlands Charm, it delivers where in lots of ways Borderlands 2 failed. And even though it seems mediocre amongst many giants coming out this year, it's defenitely my Game of the Year. I can't wait for the Doppelganger Pack release tomorrow, and like i've said many many times. This game overall is excellents. It's a must buy for borderlands fans, and a must buy if you want to try out the series. TL;DR Game overall is excellent, more of the same Borderlands you love while changing it up a bit. New players will love it, while old fans will cherish it."

Champions Online,"I have to down vote this game. There seems to be a shocking trend for big game cross platform developers to neglect keybinding in PC games. Some PC gamers have a setup that is not easy to remove a joystick for various reasons, joysticks are not easy to disable on a window system. These new games see joysicks as a gamepad and use buttons and any axis across any or all of the attached joysticks and disable the keyboard alltogether making the game unplayable. Simple fix is dont downgrade PC inputs to suit a 10-15 button gamepad."

If you take a quick look down to the negative reviews, they are active down the apologizing for their mess up. While they have implemented  micro-transactions, you do not need to buy anything. I do recommend it though, as it supports the making of future games for them. Overall, I give this game a 9.43/10"

It was true at the time but since then the game has been abandoned by the developers, traded in for the PS4 version instead. They ceased development on the PC version and have since closed down the Australian servers, making it unplayable for anyone in the area (including myself). The matchmaking for other servers is garbage as well, taking decades to find a lobby.This game is trash now and I'm glad to be not installing it again after reading the reviews for the game, and now giving my own.

A.R.E.S.: Berzerker Suit,What you always wanted out of your lego set! highly recommend
A.R.E.S.: Berzerker Suit,"I played the first, completed to 100%, found it enjoyable, It's a point and click adventure game, I had no problem picking up the second, didn't hesitate at all, The second is just as fun, lots more reading, lots of random clicking to find things, The only problem, It's super grindy, It's like you need to grind everything to just pass one spot every time, whether it be fishing, picking herbs etc,There aren't too many quests near the beginning, so you basically need to complete them all to have enough fame to continue, I found this some what repetitive and unenjoyable, I was constantly going from place to place to get more and more items for one quest because It has the last bit of fame I need to progress through to the next stage.I played the first one without stopping, I couldn't, It was too much fun, the second however, I've taken several breaks, there's only so much grinding a person can do before it's tiresom and you just don't want to do it anymore, I found the need to complete things to unlock mushroom, eggs etc quite bad, usually you'd just click and it's unlocked, not having to do quests etc to get that ability. Overall, still a decent game and I'd play it over quite a few times, If there were more additions, I would not hesitate to grab, one of my favorite point and click games."
Cities in Motion: Metro Stations,"- EARLY ACCESS REVIEW - ( Note, When I play this more (which I will), this review will change.I understand this is early access and has been for quite some time, I also understand bugs/glitches are always going to be there.I've been there the whole way through the greenlight, and I was so excited I could actually play it via steam.I'm deeply inlove with harvest moon, always have been, always will be, this is based off harvest moon, therefor i'm expecting it to be something quite like it.Overall, it has great potential, and when/if it comes out for 3DS/WiiU/Psvita, I'll also be grabbing it on thus consoles i have. I know a lot of work has gone into this game, and a lot more hours will be spent making it the greatest it can be.Pro's- Closest thing to Harvest Moon itself.- Love the details/graphics- Calming Tunes ( May get annoying after awhile )- Easy to waste a year of your life away- Early Access, ( room for improvement )- Somewhat playable- Playable via Steam- Fast and easy start up- many, many more, and I'm sure i'll have more to add when I've played more hours.Cons; Annoying Features/bugs/Glitches I noticed. (JUST BECAUSE THERE'S MORE CONS THAN PRO'S, DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A BAD GAME)- Spelling Mistakes, such as, On the sign at the farm, 'ax'. ""they're reactions are similar"", The mayor says 'they's instead of they'd ""- overused words( Dear,Gotcha,Getcha ) makes it seem unprofessional when it's there twice a sentence,- not too detailed about the actual things you need to know- walking through doors sideways and not where the door is.( On the mayors tour )- mayor disappears in the General Shop when first meeting- mistaken he/she at the farm when clearly accepted was a she.. and then says she in the next sentence.- ""they're reactions are similar""- random 0 when mayor talks about the animal attacks at the start- few music tunes from harvest moon(friends of mineral town+TreeOfTranquility). - First person to visit the farm repeats before roselyn/jessica shows back up- Massive random line of b when jessica shows the above view of town- sleep and save is glitched, Can't save, - can't sleep ( option comes up, is accepted and then nothing happens )- start is an hour long-  No sound effects ( tools, people, walking etc )- Farm Layout Is basically EXACTLY like Harvest moon ( No Originality )- Turnip Seeds glitching and becoming infinite at the start- Controls are bugged and seem to not work ( Interact Button, even when changed. Also Escape for back comes up with exit option, everytime. )"
Nancy Drew®: Secrets Can Kill REMASTERED,"As far as card games go, everyone knows they aren't as good as getting together with a few friends and dueling like the good old days, I've struggled to find a decent game that covers everything and Is absolutely fun to play, I must admit, getting the hang of It and learning which Is good and which isn't, does take some time, then again so does learning to ride a bike.This takes the top of the list for Pc card games, Also FTP, so It's definitely worth a look.:)"

ARMA: Cold War Assault,"- RECENT REVIEW -New engine, completely rebuilt, lots of updates, It's a pretty decent game again, although, having a beast computer is the only way to see the new engine at its best, It's too overwhelming on my computer, and i'm having trouble playing it with all my settings either off or extremely low.Its got lots of new additions, such as a completely new map, which is absolutely massive, and if you die without a sleeping bag placed, chances are you aren't going to find your spot again anytime soon if ever, horses, they're quite cool, and the deer, the animals are just completely awesome, except for the wolves, they could be downgraded, they run way too fast and glitch all over the place.all different types of building, wood, stone, sheet metal, reinforced, locks, cupboards, There's so many new features and additions, it's all had a makeover and is pretty.. hahaI guess it's a decent game again, depending on the server you play on, I won't be playing it as much as i used to, but it's a nice treat every now and then :)- EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -I stopped playing a fair bit after zombies were removed and replaced with mutant bears and wolves, It just wasn't as much fun, I enjoyed finding an amazing server with a decent community, running around the map on resource runs and seeing who could headshot a zombie first, Zombies really were the highlight of this game for me, after that was removed, everything went bad, there were no decent servers, there were hackers, less updates, found myself and a friend just throwing flares down a hill and watching it roll, for about 3 hours, and that was all we did. Thus, Rust had nothing more to offer for me and I completely stopped playing it.- EARLY EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -Rust well.. It's different.It may be in Alpha but it's already such a great game, I'm excited and dreading new updates, I love the way it is at the moment, not knowing if the upcoming developments will ruin what i think or make it even better, going to have to wait and find out, I spend most of my time playing this game, Surely enough playing on a populated server isn't a good idea, it'll ruin your experience all together, the key is to find a decent server with only about 20-40 people online, i'd say start off with a pve until you get the hang of things. Also playing on Official servers aren't exactly the best idea.Wolves and bears have a fair amount of health compared to the zombies, bears and wolves you have to avoid until you have a bow or a gun, zombies you can take on with a pickaxe etc. This is a great game and definitely worth the money, considering it's in Alpha, it's damn well good.I thought it'd be one of those games that look great but turn out pretty bad, Looks great, is great.The only downer for me is the fact it over heats my laptop, and that's when I play with Render Quality 0, and run it on the fastest option. The graphics are great.. but I can't really play with them. I have a decent gaming laptop.. but still It overheats so I have to take breaks and I don't like that.All in all, Great game, definitely worth a look at :)I'm sure more people would buy it if there was a demo, then again it's in alpha and only $20, Still worth a look :)I surely don't regret this game and I won't anytime soon =D"
ARMA: Cold War Assault,"Tomb Raider is amazing, It's my favourite game by far. Has been for months and will continue to be, I'm hoping there's a part 2, or a completely new game, the graphics are amazing, vocals are awesome, missions, hidden artifacts, tombs, wolves, good guys, bad guys, and that's just the campaign, I played for 13 hours, 6 and a half hours for 2 days, I couldn't stop. It's like finding a good book and not putting It down.buying this on sale would be a massive rip off, It's worth full price and so much more. People say nothing's perfect because there's always room for improvment, Tomb Raider just goes to show, Perfect does exist. Best.Game.Ever."
SpaceChem: 63 Corvi,"Another great game I can't stop playing, It's a multiple reminder of a bunch of games thrown together into one.I'm glad It's FTP, but I certainly would pay for It.Seems as It is FTP, there should be no reason for people to not check It out.It's definitely one of my top 10."
SpaceChem: 63 Corvi,"great game, Steam please give it to me but anyways so fun with firends or without it and steam plz gift it to me i really want it because its such a good game overall 100/10 i rate it because its so amazing"

Nancy Drew®: The Captive Curse,Great Game
Nancy Drew®: Trail of the Twister,"3/10This game shows some really awesome ideas and gameplay but the servers are really laggy! The training facility is basicly a game with bots to play with and very bad placed instructions. Also the key bindings are bad and there is no way to quit the game unless in the home screen but... You can't get to the home screen! I had to quit with Alt+F4. I do not recomend this game at all! It is a free game and only takes 45 minutes to download so give it a shot, there is a small chance you might like it."

Puzzle Pirates,DON'T PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE
Puzzle Pirates,The game that reduced me to madness where all I could focus on was Boris TodbringerYou may ask who is Boris well he is the leader of Middenland and I chased him for countless numbers of turns where he pillaged and raided the true empire and its lands. Boris was fortunatly slain by Karl Franz where his mighty mount deathclaw came chrasing down on Boris killing the rebel leader instantly. 10/10 would kill Boris with griffon again
Puzzle Pirates,♥♥♥♥ing peice of ♥♥♥♥ for a game. #♥♥♥♥ing done. Gets Banned for another idots mistake and being kicked from to many matchs because of trolls. Valve get your ♥♥♥♥ togheter
Puzzle Pirates,Similar to your many other vehicle games with how you have your tech tree and factions. However a differnt concept added how you can bring mulitple vehicles to the battle. Rather than having one and then getting killed at the beginning by a BS round forcing you to leave match immediately in a fit of rage.Would give this game a solid 7/10.
Puzzle Pirates,its a good sandbox game tons of server a huge time FUN ONE WORD FUN IF YOU NEED FUN GET THIS GAME!

Cities in Motion: German Cities,"A really entertaining game with solid mechanics.Unfortunately, minor things like the ability to reliably find a match come second to essentials like DLC.I'll happily update this when the game works"
Magic: The Gathering 2012 - Expansion,"Fast paced, objective based, teamwork and skills. Outplay the enemy team and sink them deep. Thumbs up for Dirty Bomb. Although it's currently in beta, with a few glitches here and there... LIKE NOT RELOADING PROPERLY! Sure you may encounter a HACKER TO RUIN LIFE. But overall, it's not pay to win, you can easily obtain what you want with just a bit of time and patience, whether it's mercs or opening AROUND 200 CASES AND GET **** ALL... sorry! I rate this game for it's objective based theme, whether you're good in gun fights or just overall terrible, there is always a merc that will suit your play style, medic, engineer, badass RHINO with a mini-gun or just simply keep ur team wealthy with ammo. :) Just remember, teamwork is key, communicate, strategize and execute together to overcome your enemy. (Teabagging is not recommended, as recalled on one of the most important rules of Dirty Bomb. Even though you're playing Dirty, don't... be... a... d.i.c.k :)"
Sengoku,"*Finishes achievement where you break all 50 of the alien goo bottles* - Is promised a reward, To this day. No reward."
Sengoku,This game makes even the crispiest people like me moist.
Sengoku,"I personally think War Thunder is a great game. But unfortunately it has it's downsides. I think i'll start with positive stuff, which is lot's.- The Graphics are amazing, but require a very good computer to actually get them.- Many of the sounds in the game are beautifully made and recorded, some of the best sound in any plane/tank simulator game.- Driving mechanics can be quite clunky, but are amazing when you get used to them.- Tank battles (arcade) can be pretty fun, especially lower tiers. Once you get higher though, it starts.....the bias.....the grinding......the broken game mechanics :(- Planes are great, but same as tanks, fun at low tier, not as much at higher tiers.Okay, now.....it's time for the brutal stuff._ *One day, Birdman Kreb's was driving his T-34 1942* While i was driving, i spotted a few enemy tanks and quickly dispatched them (surprisingly). I continued driving and ran into a Panzer IV, i also dispatched that (again surprising). Then i made the mistake and drove out of cover, and ran into a M4 Sherman. Now this is where the bull#### began. He fired on me and killed my entire crew 0_0. Now i would have been fine, if i didn't watch the replay. What i saw was, the bullet hitting my side armour (fired from the front) and hit the surface at an angle that would have made my armour more than 200mm (yes i tested this) and this somehow, bounced into my tank and killed everyone.(And if i ever get a pic of this, i'll put it up.)And yes i know about Russian bias and yes i hate it. Being in a kv-1 and taking 20+ hits from M4 Jumbo's and Stug's and a Pz IV, just seemed a bit crazy.Overall though, good game. Worth downloading (if you ahve a good computer).Just watch out for Russian Tanks, always aim for the turrets.Okay so i just out of a game, and i had my usual, T-50, T-34, Zis-30 and Kv-1. Only to be destroyed by an Su-122, that thing has a battle rating 1.3 higher than any of those tanks and is a tier higher, what is this matchmaking. >:("
Astro Tripper,"I don't even know where to start with this.......All i can say is, i didn't know what to expect from this game.So let me start with all the good stuff:D-So we have some kinda smarter AI, even at times when they aren't smart its amusing to see them flail and fall on it's face.-The campaigns are pretty damn cool, this has to be one of the first TW games i've actually enjoyed playing camp.-THE GRAPHICS, HOLY HELL. Now my computers pretty terrible, so i'm surprised i can even get it to high graphics.-The voice acting, well what do i say other than, SHAMEFRU DISPRAY!-So glad to see AI soldiers actually attempting to fire over hills and such. Although i do miss the moments where your soldiers fire into the dirt.-Pretty cool multiplayer system, althought matchmaking 0_o. Pls, i don't want to be put against lvl 1 shogunates-Naval battles are pretty unique, especially fall of the samurai. Love the first person.-ALSO WHALES, THEY HAVE WHALES 0_0 OMERGOHD WHALES!Bad stuff :(-To be honest, the cutscenes could be better. But i enjoyed laughing at the rigid clothing of the emperor as he waved his arm around and the constant shocked look of some of the characters.Overall its a pretty damn amazing game, didn't think it could beat Napoleon (until i found the guns then i started blasting samurai all over Japan) Oh did i mention that there's actual WHALES. It's good to see some fish in the ocean, oh wait sorry, i mean mammals in the water. 10/10 would whale again"
Astro Tripper,AMAZING!
Nancy Drew®: Shadow at the Water's Edge,"A fantastic follow-up to the brilliant Space-Chem, I find the process of playing this game very similar to programming.  It's all about breaking down problems into smaller components that can be composed to generate a solution. Very rewarding to see a finished solution working."
Two Worlds II - Pirates of the Flying Fortress,"If Rayman Origins was a puzzle game, that game would be called Toki Tori 2. This game is just so smooth, and I couldn't discern if the graphics were polygon or sprite-based since the game does such a good job rendering the environment.  The puzzles are suitably challenging and the introduction of new mechanics is paced really well."
Bunch of Heroes,Closest you can get to Skyrim with guns.
Bunch of Heroes,"Hands down my favorite game of all time, here is a game that knows what it's about, and doesn't care if you get it or not.  This game is hard, not arbitrarily, but in a way that challenges you to experiement and learn. The setting and story are incredibly deep, and the atmosphere is genuinely haunting and foreboding."
Duke Nukem Forever: Hail to the Icons Parody Pack,very realistic piball sim
Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance,Pedazo de juego es como jugar un CoD pero al estilo de Batman y ademas gratis muy recomendado aunque no se si todavia hay gente en su epoca se encontraban muchas partidas

The Binding of Isaac,If you like Star Wars your going to love this game it has land battles and space battles and also a campeign the quick action battles are really good if you want to play around with weapons or vechiles i would give it 9/10
The Binding of Isaac,My game is crashing ever since that update came
Farming Simulator 2011 Equipment Pack 3,Todavia depende del css?-_-
Off-Road Drive,Highly recomand to Total War fans or Warhammer fans or people that likes strategy
Off-Road Drive,"Don't buy it. It doesn't work well on Windows 10, and it looks like it never will. Apparently the developers don't care about their costumers. They are not going to fix game breaking exploits nor handle trolls. I didn't have fun playing, just disappointment. My money was thrown at people who don't deserve. Hope it helps someone to not waste money, there are a lot of better games that need support."
Supreme Commander,This game is simply awesome in all aspects. 11/10. A must buy.

Fate of the World: Denial,"16 or so hours in I am really enjoying this - looks amazing , running flawlessly for my system - no issues / crashes / meltdowns ...Did initially  have an issue with Logitech controller not being recognised ... unplugged my Siatek Hotas and restarted game and worked from the get go. ) Just wanted to post a quick review to let potential buyers know its not all doom and gloom , glad  I pulled the trigger on this. World style and looks 10/10 Character style and looks - some old favorites and awesome new ones 9/10Weapon stance and mechanics 9/10Combat - sneaky bastids 10/10 Fun / fustrutation balance 10/10 Early on , personally for me with no system or crashing issues - its a solid 9 + Would 100% be deep fried trying to sneak past Dragon again :) "
Fate of the World: Denial,"Let's start off with something, this game is amazing.When you first start off in the game your going to be put in a Battlefeild/Counter strike enviroment, choosing between two teams (Insurgency or Security), you will be faced with a detailed loadout selection and class selection. Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering ""should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead"". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can't really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game)."
Fate of the World: Migration,Great banter has been had while playing this game. 10/10 would play again.BTW ONLY PLAY WITH CONTROLLLER PC CONTROLS ARE ♥♥♥♥
Fate of the World: Migration,"The gameplays relatively the same as the main game but with more focus on branding uruks rather than killing them, but the main attraction is the One Ring which to be fair is OP againts warcheifs and makes them a breeze but i guess thats what the One Ring is, a ring of power. By far the best thing about the DLC is the final boss battle which isnt just QTE this time and   is really fun and takes around 20 minutes to beat (with about 1-2 deaths). The gameplay up to the end is a bit repetitive but the boss makes up for it."
Fate of the World: Migration,"It's a great game if you get past the peformance issues, but personally I run it fine with an FX 8320 and a GTX 960 4gb at 1080 60hz (getting around 60-65 fps and 50 lowest) at very high settings with global illumination off (cause that drops you about 10-20 frames)Now for the proper review:It's great8.5/10 could've been a 9/10 if it weren't for a few bugs and glitches and peformance issues for some people.Also the bavarium rocket launcher = 2 gud 5 me"
Fate of the World: Migration,played around with the ♥♥♥♥ model on the workshop.its ok
Sniper: Ghost Warrior - Second Strike,"Nice Game, good work GabeN"
Air Conflicts: Secret Wars,"Finished it again and again. Pretty fun to come back and play through it again while forcing myself to use different loadouts. Great fusion of action points based planning with cooldown timer and real time action.(You get to activate a mode that freezes everything and allows you to plan moves, might not execute the way you want it exactly. Also a penalty of disabling all function use after activating said feature unless you have a modifier attached to a function. If you wonder what functions are, just think them as weapons you can use, and those weapons can also be used as a weapons modifier, tons of combinations to pummel everything in your way lul)"
Air Conflicts: Secret Wars,"Join the other 8 Million people in world who have no lifes and play the russian simulator that will steal your soul, Dota 2"
Fate of the World: Extras Pack,"Please dont play this game, but if you do please dont put money on this. Please dont download and slam."
Fate of the World: Extras Pack,"Really great game, even as of now. Played it with 3 others on a computer that was streamed to a PC using Xbox controllers, very fluid and fun game. The bot AI is quite good as well, would recommend picking up if you've got a spare $10 and a couple friends laying around somewhere."
Fate of the World: Extras Pack,The only good Red Faction.
Fate of the World: Extras Pack,"9/10Definately a good game, good mechanics, servers, originality.It's so damn funny as well.Gunplay is fun, teamwork is lacking.There are Bots as well as Australian Servers.TF2 pay model. Pay for cosmetics ONLY.This is not a ""Pay to Win"" game.2 Gigabyte download.Pretty good optimisation. Did I mention it was free?Menu tutorial, no tutorial on how to play the game though. (Should be self explanitory.)"
Dead Rising 2: Off the Record,Absolute piece of ♥♥♥♥ with no redeeming qualities.10/10 - IGN
Dead Rising 2: Off the Record,Best Final Fantasy Ever.
The Baconing DLC - Roesha – One Bad Mutha Co-op Character,"This is, by far my most favourite game I have ever encountered and will never be changed.Why?Because I was brought up playing this game, as well as Team Fortress Classic (Cheers Uncle!), playing it everyday alongside my Playstation 1, SNES and Unreal Tournament.Reasons:+ Fast Paced+ Among the First and Greatest FPS games (alongside of Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem and Wolfenstein.)+ Creative+ Quality Graphics for its time (And is still a joy to look at)+ Different ways to approach situations and pathways.+ Puzzles!+ Aliens!+ Lot's of replayability+ Huge modding community! (Single Player mods [They Hunger, Point of View], Co-op Mods [Sven Co-op!], Multiplayer Mods [Counter-Strike, Team Fortress Classic - the best TF ever])- When you save in the wrong spot you may be screwed and may have to start over.- A.I can be dumb at timesSummaryThere's a reason why this was named GOTY by over 50 publications and given a 96/100 on metacritic, better than any CoD or any other generic shooter on today's market. Why buy Call of Duty: Ghosts when you can buy this beautiful gem right here?"
The Baconing DLC - Roesha – One Bad Mutha Co-op Character,"Unreal Tournament III brings back the good memorys of UT and UT2004, with upgraded graphics, tons of maps and gamemodes, polished characters and a new storyline.UT3 contains modernised graphics that can be run fairly easily (I'm running on an older laptop and it runs smoothly on high), even with lot's of action happening on screen.UT3 is fast paced, fun and rage-inducing when you keep getting dominated but finally kill them with a well-placed headshot or redemeer shot.I give UT3 a 9/10. It could easily get a 10/10 if there were more voice commands (lacking important voice commands such as ""No""), different character customisation abilities such as color (in FFA matches).

The Baconing DLC - Roesha – One Bad Mutha Co-op Character,"10/10Made by the same people who made Amnesia: The Dark Descent. This game is Amnesia, but better, longer, more puzzles, modernised (glowsticks, flashlight; shoddy one at that) and scary >:)Expect to die multiple times by spiders, dogs, naked men with umbilicle cords to their ♥♥♥♥ and rolling stones.You are a guy who is looking for his father who he never heard from since he was born, until his mother's death. You go to greenland to search for answers.$5 for this amazing series is well worth the money. Go and get it :D"
Disciples III - Resurrection,A really good strategy game for the price. A fun little story too and some great tunes.

Gratuitous Space Battles: The Parasites,great offline game
Gratuitous Space Battles: The Parasites,"Bin playing this game and they just released multiplayer, has got lots of bugs but has an amzaing potential to be good in the future. If you like space space engineers this game is for you."
Gratuitous Space Battles: The Parasites,"Ok, I've switched to a positive review now. I highly suggest picking this game up, now they've removed paid mods. BUT a note the Beth/Valve. Don't use paid mods EVER again, m'kay?"
Serious Sam: The Random Encounter,"So far so good, the default characters supplied are not underpowered and so far your success depends on your skill not what character you are using or your enemies are using"
Serious Sam: The Random Encounter,"The core mechanics of the game are perfect apart from slight (I dont even think you could call them bugs) issues such as deleting braces which can be a little difficult but nothing game breaking. As of right now the only changes/updates that I feel need to happen are more maps, make the settings more detailed and NOTHING ELSE, THE GAME WORKS, PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE CORE, IT IS PERFECTTHANK YOU"
Serious Sam: The Random Encounter,"Make sure you dont need to ever eat dinner while playing competetive, my first cooldown for leaving was 24 hours :3"

Puzzler World 2,"The journey through the game was very fun (and very difficult), and made me laugh while also making me want to stab myself in the eye with a screwdriver.The ending was amazing, my friend and I were so happy we made it to the end, and also super relieved we didn't have to torture ourselves any longer. 10/10 - Make sure no charp objects are near when playing."
Airline Tycoon 2,I got the 500 attempts achievement. Pretty much explains my experience with this game... Still fun tho

Orcs Must Die! - Artifacts of Power,Became a suicide bomber 9/11
Orcs Must Die! - Artifacts of Power,"Unlike its new sequel; Dark Souls 3, DS2 has done something that completely astounds players to this very day, something that made the game what it was. Around the launch of DS3 i would spend hours watching PvP, reviews and lore videos while i was saving for the game. One faithful day i stumbled across a review that changed my entire perspective on it, something so terrible i could not bare to spend a single dollar on that embarrasment that is DS3. The review simply stated some broken and missing mechanics that of which are alive and well in DS2. What are these key mechanics you may ask? To put it simply in a complete and utter overlook on fromsofts behalf, they managed to leave out the single thing that made DS2 so superior, so excellent. That mechanic my friend is Common Fruit.9/10 Hopefully FromSoft redeems themselves by readding Common Fruit in their new DLC and then maybe i will purchase DS3."

Tropico 4: Junta Military DLC,97% of players are complete cancer. buy it.
Sonic Generations Collection,"this is actually a seriously badass game and would recommend it even if it was at cost, but its bloody FREE! although most of the in-game features such as new classes to play as, weapons to equip, cosmetics, etc requires actual purchase, but initially  you can choose between 3 base classes (each class is defined more or less by the 4 abilities its capable of using), a tactical class that uses abilities that effect the player themself, teleportation, decoys, etc, a second class that focuses all its abilities into offensive power, and a nuetral class that has some offensive and some supportive abilities, your first character is free but to get more classes you have to either buy them outright or find some ""materials"" and ""components"" to make them and then pay with an ingame currency that your earn from doing missions, its kind of rediculous and your just better off buying stuff, not to mention only some weapons and stuff can be bought with the in game currency, but the game itself is free, so i kind of balances out, and i guess this way you only pay for the things want, but overall you can still play the game to a full extent without paying a cent"
Nancy Drew®: Alibi in Ashes,"A brilliant game, definately recommend it. When you first start playing things can seem a bit overwhelming and especially if you're playing online not everyone is forgiving towards new players, but its definately easier to complete jobs online than with bots offline. the only thing that was disappointing was that its alot more work to create custom masks than i feel its worth, you need any combination of 3 components to make one: material, pattern, and paint. and the only way to get anyone of these at a time is as a random drop at the end of each completed mission, but you also have the chance of getting bonus cash, bonus xp, or a weapon mod (mods that you have to pay ludicrous amounts for to then actually use anyway, so thats another thing), but overall its an exellent game and highly recomended. dont feel bad if you're a lpw level, it doesnt take long to level up online and doing more difficult jobs with higher level plays who can carry you through jobs."
Orcs Must Die! - Lost Adventures,"Trained under Frieza as a Frieza-race, Wore Goku's Gi, got threatend by Frieza, then got hit on by Frieza.10/10 would emotionally conflict Frieza again."
Orcs Must Die! - Lost Adventures,"bought it, love it. i invested in the nemesis bundle because i was afraid that i'd get stuck with a lame default mech, but the fact of the matter is it doesnt matter what mech you use, you can still win. i wouldnt use the term ""pay to win"" but if you're willing to put in some cash it grants you quicker access to some weapons and perks than having to play for hours on end. the only thins you have to pay for are the cosmetics, everything that affects gameplay can be acheived by earning HC (Hawken Credits) which you get based more on play time than anything else, but you can increase the amount slightly by achieving a higher score in any given game mode. there is only one thing i think could be changed, i just feel like everythings a bit over priced when it comes to using the HC, its better than a lot of other games that have a dual currency system, but it could be better, especially since when you spend 3000 credits on a perk that only works on the mech you bought it for. Ultimately, i feel like the reward system is a bit harsh because you have to buy the same things multiple times if you want to use more than one mech, but other than that its a great game and i highly recommend it"
Orcs Must Die! - Lost Adventures,"a great game that lets you play highly tactically or just equip a devestating payload of offensive weapons and still come out on top, the class-bassed system strongly promotes team work, for example: on a number of missions you need a tech, if he dies you need to restart. Mission settings such as ""onsluaght mode"" makes things interesting in the sense that you can have it off and run through the missions as intended and take your time, or turn it on to penalize slow movement due to massive hoardes that... well swarm... you every minute whether you move or not. Vast types of aliens keeps you on your toes and its a game thats overall pretty simple to learn (also has offline practice that offers hints or for you to test different load outs which is fun), then if you havent played in a while you can get right back into it, just like riding a bike"

Dungeon Defenders Halloween Mission Pack,"After the revolver update the game become so unbalanced,seems that the devs of the game don`t give a damn about the community ,changing the gameplay to be more like COD type where u can shoot a full clip of ak47 and dont give a damn about the recoil of the weapon .. u gotta love VOLVO <3<3 for all the hard working they`ve done to maintain the game balanced*sarcasm alert*..Let`s not forget about the previous update where they introduced the new in-game sounds and m4a1-s nerf.I hope they will realise the mistakes they`ve made and rebalance the game as soon as possible.♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ Volvo"
Dungeon Defenders Halloween Mission Pack,"This game is terrible. I gave it 3.5 hrs of my life and could do no more.Aside from massive plot holes (how can your phone blow up storm vents?) the whole game feels way overhyped. Combat is boring and discovering the map almost feel pointless.The graphics and city were good though, sometimes there were little things that impressed me about the gameplay. But overrall was not enough to keep my interest.Get GTA V, my recommendation."
Dungeon Defenders Halloween Mission Pack,This Game Is For People That Like RockBut If You Don't Like I Think You Will Either Way
Fractal: Make Blooms Not War,DRM Prevents activation. Don't buy.
Fractal: Make Blooms Not War,Charmingly terrible with ok graphics and nice visual designs (except for Garshasps face) mixed with horribly implemented hack and slash game mechanics and bad levels. Only really good thing about this is it's length (short).
Magicka: Horror Props Item Pack,"This game is amazingly infuriating. Buy it and gift it to your friends, just don't play it yourself.If it wasn't extended it would be even better, one playthrough was enough"

Europa Universalis III: Reformation SpritePack,"Great gamelove it to bitsit kills me (no pun intended) to give this game a bad reviewfirst things first, this is a great game, great combat system great world design, enemy design and is just overall brilliant.however, this is one of the WORST PC ports to date, in fact, i could even check the damage scaling on my weapons with plugging in my controller and pressing x on them. On top of that, sooooo many errors with the lock-on system (which is necessary if you want to play a caster build), some of the worst hitboxes i've ever seen, enemy ai problems and large problems with the rolling mechanic (which is neccessary to the game).I'm not saying this is a bad game, i just want you to know what you are getting when you buy this game"

Tropico 4: Plantador DLC,possibly one of the most fun arcade first person shooters ever made
Tropico 4: Plantador DLC,"If you are into strategy, then buy this game, it is a simple as that"
Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon,For a idle game its pretty good. Very easy and not a lot of strategy. 10/10
Magic 2012 Deck Pack 2,The game is absolutley amazing. With mods you can make this game just amazing. The work that bethesda put into this game is out of this world.
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Golden Relic Chainsword",For a walking simulatlor it is very well done. The graphics are very good. The story is so good you don't even realize that you are playing a game. 10/10 would buy again.
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Traitor Legions Pack","A absolute great game. Gameplay is very well done. Grahpics aren't the greatest, but dont judge a book by its cover, am i right? Would highly reccomend this game to anyone who loves medevil games."

"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Emperor’s Elite Pack","If you are a person who does not like to lose everything from the slightest mistake or just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ move, this is not the game for you.........In a lovely open 8-bit game where you could think things are easy then you find a path then a grenade happy medusa comes out of no where to kill you, then the biggest thing happens........ you start over again.                                     Think before playing this game and be familliar with W-S-A-D movement......ENJOY!"
Pirates of Black Cove: Origins,Nice Game 9/10
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Golden Relic Bolter","Im loving this game so much right now. This game takes the concept of super smash bros. (Punching people sensless until they disintegrate into nothingness) And spins it on its head. Basically instead of having an arrange of set moves you get 2 different weapons. This varies from character to character. I.e, Orion: Spear + Rocket propelled lance. You still have a predertermained attack patteren with light attacks. Signature moves (Heavy attacks) are different. They vary from person to person as well.Pros:-Addicting-Premium currency is for cosmetics that dont aid you-Free-Satisfying-Different game modes (custom game)-Controller support-Very easy to runCons:-Premium currency is used-No Australian servers yetThis game is simply amazing, and its still in early access!"

SATAZIUS,"at the time of this review it's only early access, Has two current mods, the classic (which is reskinned chess) and then regicide mode which is really fun, I love chess and it adds a whole new level to the game. The fact you have abilities and stats for each unit (Orks being more offensive, while Space marines defensive.) and being able to attack pieces at range / if they are a terminator or assault marine they can melee adjacent units. I found some of my strategies failed because they would be bombarded by units. If this was the final game I admit I would be unimpressed but the fact there are plenty of other modes coming and a campaign and more. I think its worth it. But.... if you strongly hate chess then I wouldnt recommend"
SATAZIUS,Buy itDownload itDownload GamerangerPlay on gameranger.Have tons of funImo better then the new one.
Fable - The Lost Chapters,"Okay, maybe I have not played this much and I enjoyed it for a bit as a fun game...However the glitches, lag, micro transactions all add up to make it a HORRIBLE game.I played one mission (Gridlock I think) where half the AI opponents would just walk mindlessly against the wall wrecking the mission.I encountered a hacker in the first 5 minutes of multiplayer which ruined that side of it to. Not to mention its current inactivity of servers.... I WONDER WHY? its a horrible game in general, there are so many better games out there.Also I do not know this for sure but the menu looks like its stolen off Blacklight: Retribution which I would rather go into and spend hours apon hours on if it was a choice between the two.However for the time I didnt experience those issues it was a fun game... Until I noticed that there is nothing left to do after the missions other then mindless pvp that is ruined by what was mentioned above."
Fable - The Lost Chapters,"Well part of me wants to reccomend it simply because the more players the better. However my game has come into issues (Just me so wont apply to you.) Therefore I havent been able to play it much, although the time I have played has been thoroughly enjoyable. I will warn you if you hate strategy and tatics and listening to teammates then do not get it. however if your looking for a more tatical and in-depth game then I will recommend it.Being australian does not help my liking to the game, theres only 3 servers for AUS. One of which has a password, the second is barely ever available and the third is a blast to play on. When its not full. Because when it is full you have nothing to do but bare with the >200 ping. However there are plenty of EU and US servers on there.If your still unsure, just look at some peoples playtimes :P while you definetly wont be able to get 1000 hours out of it since it isnt as active as it was, for $10 USD its definetely going to be worth the money if you can bare the extremely steep learning curve. Overall I still will recommend it because I go by the logic if I pay $15 AUD for a movie and get 2 hours of enjoyment, if I can get an hour for every $ I spent my money was worthwhile."
Fable - The Lost Chapters,"An amazing game, Ive since playing this game stopped playing CSGO altogether. personally I find the community a lot better and constant updates and fixing to the characters amazing. I definetly reccomend to anyone :)"
Renegade Ops - Reinforcement Pack,If you have steam and you dont have this... then you need to get it.
Crazy Machines 2: Happy New Year DLC,"Yeah, it's neato I guess. Bought oberon feyarch and a lot of people hate me now, but uh, yeah pretty solid game."
Crazy Machines 2: Happy New Year DLC,"Nearly cried because I didn't know how the game worked at first and tarr killed all of my slimes 10/10Real talk though, this game is amazing. It brought me happiness during a little bit of a hard time, which is amazing cause I sometimes stay in funks like those for a long time. They took an odd concept and executed it wonderfully for such an early game. There's a lot to do and different risks such as not having enough food, slimes escaping at the early net stage and those evil tarr slimes. There is also great reward, smiling slimes, a feeling of completing objectives you've set for yourself and just all in all happy times. Can't wait to see what else they add to the game. New slimes? New areas? New fruit? Maybe even different species of tarr. Buy this if you want a fun indie game to screw around with and can keep coming back to. 10/10 for reals"
Dungeon Defenders - Etherian Holiday Extravaganza,This game is awesome fun and its unlike any other shooter out there.
Dungeon Defenders - Etherian Holiday Extravaganza,"Enter the Gungeon is a roguelike, top down shooter, similar to games like The Binding of Isaac or Nuclear Throne. Each level/floor is randomly generated with all sorts of special rooms, combat rooms, secret areas, and of course the boss you will need to defeat to progress to the next floor. The game is perma death, meaning when you die your run is over for good, adding a bunch of challenge to the game. Gungeon has a dodge roll mechanic that is used to avoid bullets, and consumable blanks that destroy all bullets on the screen. These make the game a bit easier.There are many many different guns, buffs and active and passive abilites, allowing for heaps of potential synergies. The game is also chock full of cheesy gun related puns, and references to other games/tv shows etc.Overall this Enter the Gungeon is really fun, but it can be hard and frustrating at times."
Dungeon Defenders - Etherian Holiday Extravaganza,"An amazing FPS with lots of great customizations, abilities and guns."
Saints Row: The Third Warrior Pack,Awesome fun and really competitive.
Renegade Ops - Coldstrike Campaign,"Just like the old one, but with good servers."
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Alpha Legion Champion Armour Set","Awesome game, the feature of having a king taxing other players is amazing.

Earth Defense Force Tactician Advanced Tech Package,i like this game But there is ton of bug now so don't be surprise
Earth Defense Force Trooper Special Issue Enforcer Package,"Came for the achievements, stayed for the music, graphics and overall good game.8/8"
Earth Defense Force Battle Armor Weapon Chest,"I went into this game to be a mediocre indie nuclear survival game. I was wrongThe graphics are visually pleasing and game has never crashed on me. The scavenging and random events system feels good. It has the right number of both events and items so to make neither annoying that you're required to make hundreds of choices or boring due to lack of action. The notes at the end of each day is a nice touch.Apart from the minor bugs, I don't have any serious complaints about this game. Strong recommendation"
Oil Rush,"Awesome game, I highly recommend this game for anybody that are fans of TF2 type gameplay, And my favourite feature, customisable guns!"
Oil Rush,"Mint m8, just ♥♥♥♥ing perfect."

Fortune Summoners,I highly reccommend this game.
Fortune Summoners,"The game started off as awesome. I can remember the times when you progress into new teirs and levels, unlocking different armours, weapons, and utilities. This was great fun up to this point - until alll of a sudden - the updates happened. The diversity of different tiers and levels, dissapeared - the uniqueness of designs, gone - The all-round game play, terrible.What made this game so bad in the end, was the fact that they decided to take all the hard work, grinding, and time off all the users, and just deleted it. Sent everyone back to an abysmal tech tree which made a level 100 and a level 1 the same sturdiness (armour wise). And the devs didnt even refund those who lost their hard earned robots.The development team needs to recognise that what they are/have done has turned a great oppurtunity into a train wreck. This CAN CLEARLY BE SEEN IN REVIEWS. Unless drastic restorations to the game are conducted. YOU WILL NOT ENJOY THIS GAME."
Fortune Summoners,I saw a naked woman
Star Trek Online,"Had my eyeballs gouged out by an eagle, before being killed by a rhino. Yeah 10 cheeky buggers out of 10."
Star Trek Online,"this game is really fun, although i should recommend this to VERY good players. it is super challenging to start off cause you will  run in to bandits, dogs, bears and hunger, very often when you start. my advice is to play with friends to make gameplay more easier and fun. but if you have no friends, i will advise you to watch some youtube videos before you start."
Star Trek Online,"This game, apart from some questionable decisions from the tf2 devs, is the most fun I've ever had in a video game"
Dungeon Defenders: Barbarian Hero DLC,"Messing around with the Density, Mass, etc. is pretty fun when you can accelerate the time and see the results. The collision of two Solar Systems is definitely among one of my favourites"
Dungeon Defenders: Barbarian Hero DLC,Rust is a gr8 game i got this game after playing alot of skyrim and i dont really play skyrim much anymore the variety is gr8 and the pvp is awesome. I definitely recommend this game!
Dungeon Defenders: Barbarian Hero DLC,Goooooood Gooood Gooood
Dungeon Defenders: Assault Mission Pack,"Made the mistake of leaving the Gas Station an hour before the sun rose.  Could barely see a thing and before I had a chance to light my storm lantern, I heard a familiar chilling growl, followed by abrupt barking.Instead of making the clever decision of turning around, re-entering the Gas Station and waiting it out til dawn, I began to run blindly through the pitch black whilst the wolves took up pursuit.I stumbled across a car and now I'm stuck in it, surrounded by a pack of three terrifying black shapes who are on constant patrol.  They keep walking by the windows.  They know I'm here.And I'm slowly freezing to death.I love this damn game."
Dungeon Defenders: Assault Mission Pack,"Thought I would dislike it, initially played on boyf's account.  Then bought it for my own account because it's an abolutely amazing enjoyable addictive timesink with a simple but effective story and weirdly fun gameplay.  Proved to me I should give a game a chance first, not take it at face value."
Dungeon Defenders: Assault Mission Pack,10/10 - ign0/10 - everyone else
Jagged Alliance - Back in Action,its like minecraft with portals 10/10 - ign
Jagged Alliance - Back in Action,"Honestly, i don't see why everyone hates this game. It's great, has tons of content, and the only thing i really think it lacks right now is ""classes"", like what terraria has. Sure, it may not of been updated for a while. But nightlies are kind of like updates, so there's honestly no reason to hate this. Starbound has a few things it could improve on, like monster generation and terrain generation, but other than that it's near perfect. I'd rate starbound 8.5/10"
Jagged Alliance - Back in Action,"Back when i used to play this, it pulled me in. It was hard, and i hated it. But i thought to myself ""One day i'm going to get good at this.""30ish hours in, with 48 hours of research and homework on how to be good, and i still sucked.Horrible game, russians everywhere, don't bother."
Pineapple Smash Crew,Typical 8 hour singleplayer.
Pineapple Smash Crew,"Chances are, if you're reading this, Chivalry is not the game for you. It's your typical first person swordfighting game, but it has a massive, MASSIVE learning curve.I'd never recommend this game until it becomes an actual fighting game instead of a blocking simulation."

Choplifter HD - Night Avenger Chopper,This is the best city building game i have ever played. It does everything that simcity 2013 failed to do and more. It has good graphics. Amazing simulation. Suprisingly realistic water. And where do i start with the mods? THERE IS A MOD FOR EVERYTHING!!!!!!!! And they are easy to install using the steam workshop. (If only minecraft mods were this simple.The only annoying thing is it doens't have natural disasters. (However there is a Tsunami mod).10/10 for everything.
Choplifter HD - Night Avenger Chopper,A great game. I think they should add more science experiments and add telliscopes which would take pictures of space and give you science.
Crusader Kings II,Very Fun! Is Best Played when playing with friends! I loved playing as engineer but I also like other classes as well!ProsFREE!  Lots of Game Modes! Lots of Classes! Helpful Turtorials! Single player and Multiplayer! Lots of Different Types of Weapons! Lots of Maps!Cons To do well you need to buy a few weapons! Can be boring if playing without a friend! is vilont and bloody (Is a Pro if you like that kind of struff)! If you want good weapons without paying it can require a lot of hours!
Crusader Kings II,I love how you can charge money for the toilets. 10/10 but I so can't wait for RollerCoaster Tycoon World to Release!
Crusader Kings II,Family fun for all.
Crusader Kings II: Dynasty Shields,♥♥♥♥ merda que a steam nao que reembolsa

Xotic DLC: Pipe Works Expansion Pack,"This is the type of game that has alot of playing styles. For example stealth and Action, choose to level your character with stealth abillities or more action oriented abillities. Definitely one of the best actions games ive played so far considering how old it is as well. the game also has a great story line! and the side quest that come with the game is also worth doing!10/10 - RECOMMEND"
Xotic DLC: Pipe Works Expansion Pack,"Story is pretty good at the start but expect dissappointment at the end of the game! fighting combat is similar to Batman arkham asylum and city. where as the overall gameplay is much like assassins creed, however its not a bad thing because the game does offer upgrades on skills and weaponary so the flow of combat is not always the same. The stealth is way to easy aswell like orcs are just way too stupid and the attract button makes the game way to easy.  The nemesis system is good either having like your own army withing the system or let the orcs fight themselves within the system and see how they progress within the army. Final verdict its alot of fun! messing around with the orcs the brutal final blow kills are brutal! and having to choose to stealth or run in like a maniac always keeps the game fun and entertaining i was just dissapointed with the story of the game."

Realm of the Mad God,A really fun and addicting game to play. a bit unbalanced at  the moment (its much easier to win as thief) but still really cool it does take a while to get the hang of.
Realm of the Mad God,"Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a very ""pretty"" game, with a mix of thrill, horror and humour. Best of all it's really cheap for a game of its type, so if you have a few spare bucks, definatly buy this game, it wont let you down."
Realm of the Mad God,Too much graphics.
Realm of the Mad God,All i can say is DEFINATLY RECOMMEND now let me get back to beating this giant frog up with my mortar.
Realm of the Mad God,"lyk dis game is da best, its lyk ♥♥♥♥, big fat oprah ♥♥♥♥!"
Hearts of Iron III: Dies Irae Stars &amp; Stripes Spritepack,DLC better than Fallout 4
Saints Row: The Third - Gangstas in Space,"Literally the best game ever made, the storyline is the best and the quests are really fun. The fighting in this game is effortless and smooth. Great steal if the game is on sale!Highly recommend it to anyone with a decent computer."
Pickers,best game imo
Pickers,one of the best steam punk games on the marketnot really much more to say.
1000 Amps,"This is a great action packed game with great graphics!  It has three game modes including single and co op campaign with 6 different races. The campaign can be set on easy, normal, hard and very hard.  The second game mode is multiplayer. You can also choose of 6 different races and their costume colors. You can do many different things on multiplayer, for e.g: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 etc. But my personal favourite is Last Stand. You can choose out of 6 races (or 7 if you have dlc) and can the play on two different maps. You play with three different people and as you gain more experience you can make your character stronger by giving him armor, weapons, and traits and abilities. You should seriously think about getting this game!"
1000 Amps,"Such an Epic game! It's fast-paced and intense, but getting 100% on a song is very satisfying. One of my favorite songs to play on it is the ""William Tell Overture"". The ups and downs of that music suits Beat Hazard perfectly, and can be a real challenge!"
Assassin's Creed® Revelations - The Lost Archive,"This game is cool if you like total RNG-based grindy, oftentimes frustrating, games. Even then, it's not ready for shipping. English is pretty terrible, too much extraneous fluff, and a total disconnected feel from your decisions.2.5/10 until really fixed"
Assassin's Creed® Revelations - The Lost Archive,"I got this game 4 days ago. A day and a half of those four days was spent on this game. It's difficult to put down, and I love it so much!"
Rayman® Origins,"Pretty awesome game. I've playing for about two weeks, and if it's distracted me from modding Skyrim, then it's definitely something great. One of the aspects I appreciate most is the foundry: the freedom to create a DnD-esque questline and, eventually, campaign of your own! Granted, the game itself is awesome and a challenge* if you do it right!In other words: 8/8 m8*note: challenge does not account for everyone, it refers to the way I play."
Rayman® Origins,10/10 would buttassbutt again

Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters,"CS:GO is the most recent entry to the counter strike series, if you're not famillar with this series, its an online tactical first person shooter, developed by the good old people at valve, with hidden path entertainment helping with this entry. it comes with much improved graphics compared to previous entries.. you must be precise and tactical with your movements, the most satisfying thing about this game is mastering the huge learning curve it comes with, and be warned this game is difficult compared to other shooters on the market, but once you become a master at pulling off clean headshots with ease, mastering each each weapon.. trust me you'll be satisfied! Plus the game has workshop support, various skins for each weapons, new versions of classic counter strike maps (dust, office etc.) new game modes are introduced, whilst classic game modes return, and at a fair price, you could do alot worse, Definite Must Buy!"
Bumbledore,"Much better game than Gearbox's Colonial Marines, Three campaigns Alien, Predator, and marines and great multiplayer. Unlike Gearbox. Rebellion knows how make a great Aliens (and Predator!) game, so go grab you Pulse rifle and LETS ROCK!!"
Bumbledore,"I quite like Rust but it's definetly not perfect, Rust is basically DayZ, Minecraft and garry's mod combined into one game, for the most part it's pretty good but Rust is a bit Rusty at it's early stages (see what I did there) because as most of you know, Rust is still in early access which means developers are still working on the game and there's quite a lot of bugs (seriously there is) and it's the simple things like not getting into a server and not being able to craft items and other bugs and glitches that are really annoying, as it stands now, it's a solid game but I wanna see what happens for Rust in the future 20 bucks I think is a bit steep for what it is at the moment, but if you wanna give this game I try I say go ahead it gets an 8/10 rock holding cave men"
Bumbledore,Just.Get this game. Please. You'll thank me later. 10/10 screaming psycos
Dungeon Defenders - President's Day Surprise,"Chivalry is a great game and theres not much games like this around, I mean steam is over saturated with generic shooters that are not really unqiue in there own right, but chivalry studies the likes of the medievil times and the medievil times hasn't really been done in video games all that much,I mean you couldn't really count the elder scrolls games as medievil because there not there fantasy but back to chivalry, chivalry has some awesome gore splattering gameplay, some pretty good graphics and chivalry is just all around fun, if I could name some cons about chivalry it would be that In my opinon the price point is asking for a bit too much I mean you've got games like counter strike global offensive and garry's mod that's only 15 bucks and packs like a mind boglging amount of content, but Chivalry also has a bit of learning curve which is not a bad thing but it's just something to consider, Chivalry is an amazing game it's not perfect but it's a game you should definetly consider letting into your steam libary if you can find Chivalry on sale on steam definetly pick it up if you can you will not regret it (seriously you won't) it scores a 9/10 dismembered heads."
Dungeon Defenders - President's Day Surprise,v good
Dungeon Defenders - President's Day Surprise,"This game is nothing short of incredible. Dont look up spoilers and go into the game blind. The story is incredibly well written and I grew attached to the characters It felt like my choices really mattered. The gameplay is incredible and intuitive and is quite challenging. The music is amazing and I havent grown this attached to an OST since Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. I havent felt this way about finishing a game since To The Moon and Solatorobo. I wasnt sad because of the story, I was sad because the journey was over. I cant recommend this game enough, easily an 11/10 for me."
Dungeon Defenders - Quest for the Lost Eternia Shards Part 2,"For a developer that does game development in his spare time, hes certainly done a good job with Bit Blaster XL, its quite addictive!The style is nice and the visuals are pleasant to look at, and the animations are simple yet fluid. The music is catchy but can get a little old especially when youre grinding credits for newer ships, especially since theres a song tied to each ship. The controls are a little stiff on keyboard but are a little bit better with a controller, it does make landing hits a bit harder (but that could be me only using the controller briefly).If you want a cheap and fun game to kill time then I definitely recommend this. Its also available on iOS and Android.-------OverallPros:-Nice simplistic 8bit inspired style-Nice music-Good controller support-Cheap priceCons:-Keyboard controls are a little stiff-Music is tied to individual ships and can get a bit repetitive when youre grinding credits for new ships."
Dungeon Defenders - Quest for the Lost Eternia Shards Part 2,"This game is surprisingly good, I recommend it if youre looking for a new coop game to play with friends or just a nice open world game mixed with parkour. Story (6/10):  While nothing special it does have its set of memorable characters. The main cast is pretty average and forgettable but the characters in the side quests are hilariously whacky and memorable. Graphics (8/10):  The game is absolutely beautiful and has flawless triple monitor support. You can see ripples on the clothing, grass and trees moving in the wind which only gets better during raining and storming weather. The facial animations on non story critical characters are a little stiff but the animations are pretty good otherwise.  Gameplay (8/10):  The gameplay is pretty good and the parkour is pretty smooth, it may be no mirrors edge but it still boasts a lot of similar parkour. The melee combat is where the game shines with upgradable melee weapons that degrade over time, you can get perks to help make your weapons last longer but even at higher level youre still watching your melee weapon usage. The gun play is pretty good and im disappointed the guns dont wear down Far Cry 2 style but it balances out since melee weapons do more damage.The night time can be absolutely terrifying right up until higher levels, my first experience with night time was an adrenaline rush even in coop.The game will feel very familiar to those who've played Mirror's Edge and as a fan of Mirror's Edge, i can easily recommend this game for those looking for a new parkour game. Controls:  I'm not giving a score on this since I played it on both PC and Xbox 360 controller controls, so I'll write a mini review for it.The PC controls are pretty good but the mouse sensivity takes time to get used to (i really cant explain this problem) but it still feels very natural compared to most multiplatform titles. The Xbox 360 controlers however, are clunky and take a lot of time getting used to but still very playable ones used to it. Coop (8/10):  The coop is pretty damn good, its peer2peer and you join the client's game and you do their quests and story. Its drop in and drop out so you can leave and join anytime. The ""Be The Zombie"" gamemode is similar to the Dark Souls invasion and can make even the most battle hardened survivors work together. I really recommend this game if youre tired of all the current coop zombie games like CoD zombies, Left 4 Dead 2 and Killing Floor. Technical Info:  This game isnt quite optimized for PC and my first 5-10 hours involved me having a problem where the cutscenes would run at 15fps despite pulling 40fps in triple screen resolution (5760x1080) and apparently its coming problem but looks like its fixed now (it happened to different people no matter the resolution or setup).The game has flawless triple monitor support and the side screens darken when entering cinematics. I recommend keeping ""View Distance"" at the default or turning it down because it has a major performance impact for little effect (it just makes foliage more visible in the distance, thats it).Apparently this game has very very basic Oculus Rift support but I havent tested it until they get something worth testing."
Dungeon Defenders - Quest for the Lost Eternia Shards Part 2,This game is addicting as hell. I would love a multiplayer deathmatch mode.
Cubemen,This game is really awesome and fun
Cubemen,I recommend getting this game because it is super amazing!! Playing with friends and randoms has never been so much fun. Different types of gamemodes and more laughter each time you play it. Get it now!! :)

Dungeon Defenders Lucky Costume Pack,Portal is a great game and gives a good amount of fun and brain teasing to the user
Dungeon Defenders Lucky Costume Pack,When im low on your mom jokes this is the game to play to stock up
Dungeon Defenders Lucky Costume Pack,"been playing this game for a few years, very solid. loving the frequency of updates and map additions. 10/10"
Space Ark,I loved this game completed it in around 2-3 days. I was dissapointed in this as I didn't have much time to 'connect' with the game as its only around 4 hours long. Odysseus: Long Way Home is a hidden-object game with a few other puzzle's included. The graphics wern't bad and the cutscene's made great screenshot opportunities. The hidden object scene's were fairly challenged but it got a bit repetative. I found the puzzle's  a little challenging and fun but there wasn't as much as I'd hoped there was. This is a great game to pass the time when you have nothing to do.
Space Ark,"TL; DR version: for $9.99, this dlc is short and does not add any real content to the game that you can not go without.Now for the long version. I got this dlc as a part of my season pass, so I didn't pay the $9.99 price tag. But if you didn't buy a season pass and are considering buying this dlc separately, I recommend you do not.There are really only two new characters with a decent amount of interaction introduced in this dlc. One I felt was developed very well, and will keep as a companion for a while. The other, was very shallow. There was barely any character development to make me feel anything for them. They could have been a no name raider and plucked at the same heartstrings during the big choice of this dlc.The robot customisation added by this dlc is quite neat. All of it balances nicely with no obvious power play options. And it's fun to have your own custom companion. But this, ultimately, is no different to any other companion. Sure, I can give them sword arms, but I could just give another companion a sword for the same effect. The interface is also slightly confusing; it is difficult to follow what change in damage/resistance a mod will cause without doing the manual check yourself. I was beginning to trust those little +++.Coming into this dlc with a lv 50 character (playing on survival) I really only felt challenged on combat at one stage in this dlc. That's not isolated to this dlc though, I feel fallout 4 has difficulty issues regardless. But this dlc does nothing to rectify this.Oh and if you're not a junk hoarder then I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors amassing your new hoard if you want to build any decent robot mods.There are a few new weapons added in this dlc as well, with the majority being mele, then energy. These are not something a level 50+ is going to start using though. Even with full modification, they fail to pack any considerate punch.There are also some unique power armor mods added in this dlc, but they are non transferable and will only benefit energy weapons users.In the end this dlc adds some cool features to your settlement and a cool new companion, but other than that there is nothing really new that is worth the $9.99 pricetag if you're considering buying this dlc outright."
Space Ark,"When this game was first announced at E3 all those years ago, I joined the growing communioty following it. I eagerly awaited any new information. Gameplay videos. Interviews. Articles. Anything to give me an insight into what this game would be. And let me tell you now: all of that information, was a lie. The game that you could buy here today is not the game that was promised, not the game that was shown. If you are only hearing about this game now, don't look at any information release prior to August 12. Make your decision from anything released after this game was. Only that will allow you to make an accurate decision as to whether or not you will enjoy this game. If you have been waiting as long as me, forget everything you have learnt and start anew. You will no longer be as eager."
Ys: The Oath in Felghana,"So many levels of fun if you love rockets, explosions and physics. Great Mod community. 10/10 would send jeb to the mun."
Ys: The Oath in Felghana,"Beautifully simple game. There are a lot of zombie survival sims these days but Unturned is currently on the top of my list. Why? Because it's so simple. There isn't the stress of other multiplayer survival games where your heart gets pumping at the slightest hint of a human player. If you die, you collect again. And you don't feel defeated doing so. I cant wait for future updates for this game. Right now its just got the basics, and its already so fun. And its FREE. I have bought gold for this game, simply because I felt like supporting the developer. But you dont have to pay to win. I highly recomend this game."

Midnight Mysteries 4: Haunted Houdini,classic
Tropico 4: Modern Times,Very good Game!! My Favourite of the Arma series! Very good Graphics and very good weapon systems!
Tropico 4: Modern Times,"Brütal Legend is fantastic! As a metal fan myself, I'm totally into the focus on metal music throughout the game. Jack Black does a fantastic job at giving life to the character Eddie, and the appearance of Ozzie Osbourne is very amusing too. Full of action (the gore option is hilarious) and great comedic dialogue. Awesome game, would totally recommend to anyone with a metal edge or a fan of Jack Black's!"
3SwitcheD,"One of the best indie games ever made. Spelunky is randomly generated done right. The game is always a challenge, and at the start may seem repetitive or frustrating, but the more time you pour into this game, time this game deserves, the more you will notice the complexity and fascinating level of depth the game has.GameplayThe game might not be for everyone, in that victory is not guaranteed and a simple mistake may mean restarting from the first level of the game. You play as a spelunker and a boiled down summary of the aim of the game is to get to the next level by maneuvering from the top of the level to the exit at the bottom, all the while avoiding a multitude of enemies and traps. Each playable character (and there are a variety to choose from) is equipped with a whip to kill enemies or smash pots or deflect arrows. Really it serves as a multipurpose tool.GraphicsColourful, vibrant and beautiful 2D art that complements the game perfectly. Pretty explosion effects. It is a nice looking game.ReplayabilityConceivably infinite. Every level is different as they are all randomly generated. It is highly unlikely you will ever play the same level twice and if you did you would most likely not notice as you'd be too busy whipping bats and jumping spikes and enjoying avoiding death.It took me 100 hours of co-op to beat the game with my brother and that was most fulfilling experience ever. And technically I haven't actually beaten the game yet as I only defeated one of the games bosses.Highly recommend this game. 10/10"
3SwitcheD,"The game is fun. Invite friends over and take turns getting killed in visceral, blood-splashing 8-bit detail. The game might not be for everyone; if you don't like pixel art games, if you don't like killing people, if you don't like trippy 80s inspired psychaedelic visuals or collecting animal masks, then this game might not be for you. It's fun, it's fast, it's infuriating and, importantly, it's rewarding.For only $10, Hotline Miami is a bloody steal."
Train Simulator: Freightliner Class 70 Loco Add-On,Yesss~~~buy this please
Dungeon Defenders: Series EV Hero DLC,Fun yes
Dungeon Defenders: Series EV Hero DLC,"Medieval mode, though stolen, is amazing. WARYERS UNITE!"
Dungeon Defenders: Series EV Hero DLC,"This is one of the best games that i have ever played my entire life, this game will take you on an adventure into space with the help of the lotus and your friends and people you will come across this game will be the next goty for pc users all around who love space and ninjas. Now im a pretty big gamer on warframe and have gotten pretty far within on getting warframes and weapons but when an update comes out you just better get on and see what is new for what you will get and even with this one it is just amazing with the new frame and the weapons that have been added into it. And also that not just weapons and a frame but also a new ship as well which is an improvement to having a new kind of ship which you will need to find the parts and buy the blueprint in the shop and once your done making it, you have yourself a new ship. This game will make you wanting to keep on playing and not stop so go ahead and grab this game and play it for yourself and have fun tenno, we are all counting on all of you"

Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece,this is really one of the most best games i have played in my time of gameing
Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece,this is the most awsomest game i have played because you can use a variety of different kinds of dragons and weild a weapon of choise the first three dragons you keep after you complete the tutorial but the ones that are free they change all the time to a different one it also happens to weapons as well but it is a good way to experience new ways of using your dragon and weapon for speacial combinations
Confrontation,"Ok I just have to say this, I have once liked TF2 but after some time of playing this game i have slowly started to hate this game so much, reasons why you might want to ask me is that i have not really liked the admins of certain cervers (mainly the two pony cervers im on and some others as well) with getting new ones and getting rid of once good ones who i have actually liked. This game is also used for the shop which is used for the keys to unlock these crates that are usually what you might get over a nice weapon or a rare chance of a simple hat. But honestly do people really want to spend over 30 or maybe 60 but not even exactly 100 dollars on some stupid ♥♥♥ ring that no one will ever buy for unless they really wanted to spend it on that damn thing, I say no you can get anything you wanted thats not some cosmetic item for your classes to all wear but i say that these items that i have seen and the new things that have even appeared in this game are just useless, all you get are some weapons or the main thing of hats which i have seen over the time that i have played this damn game. But unlike other games i have seen or played such as CS:GO also do the same thing with the shopping mechanism of the keys and crates for weapons. But as for TF2 I would say that i wouldn't even dare to touch or play this game even if they have made some good buffs but after that gunn metel update it just made it all go away for me and started to not even play it one single bit. Now if anyone would give me a single reason as to why i should play this game and i mean a good one not that ""its so fun and amazing and that you can play with friend"" just like any other game i have and that one of my friends have to play on i want a really good reason that you can easily persuade me to start this game up again once more and to prove that it will be worth my while then i will be playing it but otherwise i am not playing it worth anything even if i were to get an unusual which would cost me something or if anyone gave it to me for free. It's not happening and it is final"
Confrontation,This has got to be the most best game and series of the red faction games and i have played the first and second red faction then after completing them and armagedon and started playing this and getting through most of the game i have just loved the entire series and I just know that anyone else who plays the games will love them as well.
Confrontation,"Difficult but quite satisfying Turn based RPG..More for veterans of this style of game(it sort of assumes you've played this type of game before), it's worth the time put into it, some didnt like it but I liked the challenges.Storyline is pretty decent, some nice voice acting all the way through."
Train Simulator: Settle to Carlisle Route Add-on,Ehh its alright. (wasted my life)
"Hack, Slash, Loot",Awesome Game!!!
"Hack, Slash, Loot","this game is by far the best indie game aver created. there is a plethora of weapons, armours, enemies and bosses to defeat, craft and collect. and i wont forget there are PETS, YAY"
"Hack, Slash, Loot",If you haven't heard of this game you aren't worthy of PC gaming. If you have played it/play it you are an absolute god!

Risen 2: Dark Waters,"After playing Mitos.is for a little bit, I can safely say this is a good game. It offers fast gameplay like Agar.io would, but, unlike Agar.io, it eliminated one of the things that made me say that Agar.io was bad. The lag. Other than that, Mitos.is gives more gameplay aspecs then Agar.io, these come in as Zombies Vs Humans, Free For All, Team Fortress, and a variety of others.Humans VS. ZombiesThis gamemode is where you play as either a blue human, or a red zombie, you infect others by shooting yourself at them (Using the W key.) Once a team has reached over 5000 points, a countdown timer will begin. Once the timer has finished, the winning team will  be crowned winner, and a new match will form.Free For AllFree for all is what you would expect, you play as a ball eating random things to become bigger, so you can eat bigger balls to become the biggest on the server.All In all, this is a good game, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to kill some time."

Dungeon Defenders: Quest for the Lost Eternia Shards Part 3,This is the best game I have ever played (i have played the last of us) This game needs to recieve more love. It is so emotional and the Story is amazing and I cannot stop thinking about it. I give it a 9/10. I no the last of us recieved a 10/10 but that is increibly high for it because the gameplay was so short. This game gives a on_going rush and you cannot wait for what is going to happen.

Binary Domain,"So I've wasted 182 hours of my life in this game. Getting yelled at by my friends, Hiding offline, but it was totally worth it. There are so many things you can do in this amazing Open World RPG. At the beginning you can create your own character, which is kind of cool. There really is no ending to this game. You can play at your own leisure. Besides getting yelled at by friends and the case of the removals, this game is worth the money. If you ever get bored and/or beat the game, there is an excellent collection of mods at the workshop and a website called nexus mods. This game is highly recommended to anyone who is into open-world games or rpg's. But one last thing, as soon as you get the game, you cant stop playing it."

Toy Soldiers,"Great game, very similer to Smash bros brawl also looks a but like tynker if anyone even knows what that is."
Toy Soldiers,"As far as early access games go, I have to say you want to jump on board this one as soon as possible. Graphics, Gameplay, level design and even well designed AI make this game a hell of a good BETA. It will leave you with generally only one main complaint, and thats content.Now of course content will be lacking in an early access title, but grip has managed to create an experience where, even though there is only three maps for racing at the moment, each race will leave you with a different opinoin. This is thanks to level design, incorporating the abillity to drive up walls, take side paths (both of which are usually drasticly different) and landing good items and benefital positions.The Kaos of the race, explosions everywhere while you narrowly avoid rocks and ramps wizzing past you, while dust sprays from the back of your tires all the while trying to keep an eye out of the player infront of you, makes this game really really fun. If you apreciate the intencity of a race, this is perfect for youLong story short, you will pick up this game thinking ""This game has so much potential"", and at this rate, I think it would be pretty hard to screw up."

Train Simulator: Settle Carlisle Specials Add-On,"Its ok but not great yet. It takes ages to ""rank up"" and you only het 5xp for each kill. If you get into a battle that has not started you must wait 2:30min for it to start. The weapons are overpriced.  Its realistic but needs a lot of work. For a f2p game it is ok."

Dead Hungry Diner,"The King Is Back Guys , Enjoy !!!"
Dead Hungry Diner,"This game is an casual platformer dedicated to everyone but mostly to under 14 , you control a kitty which have to collect shinies across various levels accompanied by some nice music, there is not much depth to it but is fairly made and simply, you will not be punished if you die, you just start from the last checkpoint, you can play with only Mouse or directional keys on the Keyboard.Considering the price I think is slighty 'fat' for what he can offer."

Farming Simulator Farming Classics Pack 4,"Great concept, but extremely bad execution.What was fun: social aspect and level of co-op either with friends and matchmaking (sometimes).What wasn't: unprofessional dev attitude, rushed release hence bugs, glitches, and hackers. To top it off, loot system is extremely broken.Avoid this on PC, hackers galore. Developers have had no concrete response to tackling hackers. In fact hackers have no fear playing this and posting their hacking videos on YT. Developers enforce a 3 day ban followed by permanent ban but are being circumvented by hackers simply changing their names. Glitching has been rampant for a while now, and no actions have been taken to resolve this issue also, which means most people are OP in PvP. There are also so many bugs relating to connection, the quality of servers are intermittent at best, while several of the talents do not even work. In fact, sometimes they are the oppostite. The attitude of Ubisoft and Massive are: close threads down of anyone posting any negative feedback, while communicating the absolute minimum: the silence indicates that this game is in trouble. The fact that vendor blueprints are more exciting that loot drops is alone a sign of a completely broken game.I thought I'd be proven wrong by forking out early and getting the GOLD and Season pass, but I regret this. Apart from the extremely brief social co-op experience this game provided, the only other positive that I've gotten out of this game is to never every buy a game and season pass that Massive/Ubisoft have laid their dirty little fingers on."
Ticket to Ride - Europe,There is no where to start with the review of this game. It is just unable to be explained. Play it to see what I mean.It's good.
Ticket to Ride - Europe,"A great game. I found the story the be fairly well written and easy to follow, despite a few certain twists. I found the fighting very basic, yet at the same time, you could chain all your moves and feel like a total badass. You do not have to complete any of the side quests, and most of them are pretty useless. Overall i found the game to be a fun and enjoyable title."
Ticket to Ride - Europe,10/10Would build again.
Ticket to Ride,"Dear Re-Logic CONGRADULATIONS on making a spectacular game that has graced millions of players with its presence including meTerraria a 2-d platformer with survival,crafting and battle integrated into it has made the game become one of the most successful games i have come to know as well as the entire gaming community. Terraria has endless possibilities with its designing features and combat. You can design a multilevel mansion, or a medieval castle. or even a UFO now with the recent 1.3 update added to the game. You can pick up a laser drill and terraform and entire biome for anything you desire, or you could pick up the legendary last prism and become Terrarias next Merlin.Terraria is a game for all ages and is thorughly enjoyable.

Definitely recommend trying this game since it's F2P, but be warned it does take some time to get used to and will leave you raging most of the time. I advise you watch some Youtube tutorals, Wrel has a good channel and will give you an in depth explanation of many aspects within the game.

Binary Domain - Multiplayer Map Pack,"The McDonald’s we’ve known for more than half a century is changing. Whether due to shifting market trends or a mid-life identity crisis, the Golden Arches has decided to completely reinvent itself as an upmarket restaurant chain. It’s a bold new direction for the company with a focus on premium ingredients, dine-in perks and customer creation via “Build-A-Burger” touch screens. Yesterday, we tested the fancy new service at its maiden store in Castle Hill, NSW. The results exceeded our wildest expectations.The McDonald’s we’ve known for more than half a century is changing. Whether due to shifting market trends or a mid-life identity crisis, the Golden Arches has decided to completely reinvent itself as an upmarket restaurant chain. It’s a bold new direction for the company with a focus on premium ingredients, dine-in perks and customer creation via “Build-A-Burger” touch screens. Yesterday, we tested the fancy new service at its maiden store in Castle Hill, NSW. The results exceeded our wildest expectations.Study the above photo. It doesn’t look like your typical Macca’s fare, does it? Remove the tell-tale cup and it could almost be a burger from a glitzy steak house or high-end pub. What you’re looking at is a bespoke burger packed with an Angus beef patty, lettuce, tomato, egg, smoked Applewood bacon, red onion rings, jalapenos, grilled mushrooms, chilli jam and no less than four types of cheeses. (Yep, I went all in and I don’t regret a thing — but more on that later.)This is what McDonald’s wants to become in Australia and it’s pulling out all the stops to make it happen. While the service is currently only available in a single Castle Hill outlet, the company is embarking on a nation-wide roll out over the next two years. Consider it the final step in McDonald’s hipster gentrification (hipsterfication?) — a process that arguably started with the Angus and M Selection range.So how does it work? If you just want to grab a quick ‘n’ dirty Big Mac, McDonald’s will still cater to you via the usual ordering process. However, there’s also a touch screen kiosk where customers can get a whole lot fancier. There are several ready-built deluxe burgers to choose from, although the emphasis is firmly on customer creation.There are more than 30 ingredients to choose from, including two types of buns, four kinds of cheese, two types of bacon and a range of specialty toppings including grilled pineapple, guacamole, beetroot, grilled mushrooms and a range of gourmet sauces. Handily, the display automatically tallies the kilojoule count of your order after you’ve added all the toppings.The touch screen interface has been built to impress: it’s large, responsive and easy to navigate with visual representations of all the available ingredients. With the possible exception of geriatric Luddites, the UI shouldn’t give customers any trouble. (Trained staff are hovering nearby just in case you have any questions.) You can also order standard menu items from the touch screen, which means you don’t have to split from your lunch partner if they just want a Quarter Pounder.Once you’ve made your selection you can pay for it instantly via an inbuilt credit card terminal. You’re then presented with a receipt and invited to sit down as your meal is freshly prepared. It will then be served to you on a dinky wooden platter. (Plastic trays are for bogans, dontcha know.)The new menu doesn’t look like fast food and it doesn’t act like it either: waiting times are significantly longer than McDonald’s customers are accustomed to. It took close to 15 minutes for my order to arrive by which point I was completely famished. Mind you, this is fairly typical for a non-fast-food burger so I won’t begrudge them too much.Just be aware that you might be in for an even lengthier wait during peak meal times. The manager I spoke to admitted that things can slow to a crawl when lots of bespoke orders come in at once. If your time is limited, our advice is to show up at least an hour before the lunch/dinner crowd.When my burger finally arrived, I was immediately impressed with the size and construction. If the ready-made options are anything like this, we may have the first perfect Takeaway Truth score on our hands. But looks can be deceiving. For as long as anyone can remember, McDonald’s has been synonymous with cheap, bland food. Would this be more of the same with a higher price tag?The answer is an emphatic no. Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the best McDonald’s burger I’ve tasted by a significant margin. It may even be my favourite fast food burger, period. The combination of familiar Macca’s meat and gourmet toppings went together wonderfully. My only reservation is that it was a bit hard to eat due to its massive size. Annoyingly, McDonald’s doesn’t include plastic cutlery with orders unless you ask.Apart from that tiny caveat, I really don’t have anything mean to say about this burger or the upscale service that spawned it. Would I pay $30 for a version with the lot? Of course not. But for $15 or so, this is a perfectly acceptable meal — attractive, delicious and so very filling.In conclusion, McDonald’s has clearly realised it needs to adapt with the times and it is moving confidently in the right direction. Fast food just got a serious upgrade. Colour us excited."

Waveform: Eris,would be yes if this game didnt cost more than whats expected..should be renamed from 'tea party simulator' to 'extra chromesome simulator'its way too hard to play.
Waveform: Eris,"Absolutely Great game. No arguing that.I can say without hyberbole This is the unquestionable Lovechild of Warchunder, kerbal, microsoft flight simulator, robocraft, and every sandbox build games ever made. and this is better than all of them.Completely boundryless when they say the skys the limit there is no better game than this.  if it flies you can build it helicopters and certain time period planes, sweep winged planes cannards. the only down side is call it that with the game is there is no multiplayer yet, and The non diagetic guitar music will make your ears ring after a hour or so, but that can be muted. everyone whos calling the game bad must be deported to the middle east to see the definition of bad. And let me just say this game is and always will one of the best purchases i made since Garry's mod since they are games like this cannot possibly be bias and the Devs will actually let you have a voice! (Unlike others((WoT))"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,"now i dont usally write reviews to games but this is beond belief. the models are clearly re-textured from earlier arma games. and there are only like 20 vehicles in game, and most of them you have to pay extra money to have them. seriously , why buy $50 for a game thats going to ask for more money for less stuff. the only good thing in the game is the charecter customizer and thats not much to be cared for."

Krater,"Get it!Especially if you've watched the anime. The anime is one of those rare exceptions where it's better than the source material (this visual novel), but the visual novel has a lot of different scenarios and endings that aren't included in the anime. There are some translation errors but they're pretty easy to figure outI recommend watching the anime first then playing the game, but that's really personaly preferrence, it really doesn't matter. Just what I'm used to.If you end up getting the game or watching the anime (or both), prepare yourself for some deep ♥♥♥♥. As in, I ended up writing down notes to understand the story. It's great.

Sift flour into a large bowl. Stir in sugar. Make a well in the centre. Add milk mixture. Whisk until just combined.Step 2Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Spray with cooking oil. Using 1/4 cup mixture per pancake, cook 2 pancakes for 2 minutes or until bubbles appear on surface. Turn and cook for a further 1-2 minutes or until cooked through. Transfer to a plate. Cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining mixture, spraying pan with cooking oil between batches."
Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 3 Collection 2,Wanted to like it but i just found it boring
Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3,"This game has been an extremely big let down, to explain my point I will use a metaphor. Games are like pools, minecraft for example is ""infinite"" and has enough depth you can put your head under while standing, and most AAA games are, quite deep and take you on an journeys regardless of how ""large"" pool is. And to put plainly NMS is kiddy pool infinite in size. Extremely simple and impossible to do more then one or to things with. Although on its own this game would make good early access $30 game, but the slew of missing content raise more questions then answers we have ever got from the Hello Games dev team e.g Planets orbiting, ships class system, naming ships, flight control that isn't a form of dumb down auto pilot, the depth and complexity of the crafting and elements system. Now based on what versions of the games with have seen threw trailers and ""gameplay footage"", it's looks as if the game has now become extremely simpler then the version we are playing now. Some reddititors have gone threw the footage from E3 and the likes, and have said that what we saw was very likely a real version of the game based some key artifacting that could of easily been removed in a pre baked animation e.g AA although this isn't 100% confirmed yet.This just my opinion, but it looks as if NMS has been effected by its need to run on the PS4, with the potential of Sony pulling strings forcing Hello games making the game simple to reach wider audiences and there for more buyers.With all this in mind it is best to hold on to that $60 USD till one of these things happen:1. They update the game bringing it closer to the E3 versions and promises made.2. They reduce the price, justifying the content or lack there of.3. A better and cheaper game that is similar comes out"

Divine Divinity,"TBH// This game was OVERhyped, I fell in love with the short but meaningful story, but the game wasn't like the trailers (much like most games) but I really had a good feeling about it. Sometimes the game can be hard. ( 7.8/10 ) *too much slow motion*"
Crusader Kings II: African Unit Pack,"Its very good! Even after years of playing I still somehow find myself on this game, BUT, the bad physics engine can be funny, however, its very buggy and annoying. Crashes aren't rare either. The support is massive and thats what keeps the game going. ( 9/10 ) *too much water*"
Xotic DLC: Warp Field Expansion Pack,"The Game is very funny with only mild teen humor (how is that possible) I love it, very fun. but you could introduce and EASY mode just for messing around that has like 3 lives and checkpoints, but the timed runs are difficult. ( 8.7/10 ) *too many cats*"

Magic 2013 “Pack Instinct” Deck Key,"From the first game to the last. The Fnaf series has been an amazing horror, story driven indie games. Fnaf3 is packed full of challenges and hidden secretes, but this does not take away from the story or corrupt it. i like the feature of the devices failing and the hallucinations are awesome! People think these games are a one scare game you buy and leave, but it isn't because of fascinating story about the children murders and the fun and unique game devices. i rate the new installment 9,5/10. I only wish that sometimes your deaths are cheated.      CANT WAIT FOR FNAF4!"

Might &amp; Magic: Heroes VI - Pirates of the Savage Sea Adventure Pack,"This game used to be a fun game with an even playing feild but now it is a crappy game with no where near a fair playing feild. For all the conspiracy theorist  out there that want proof of UFO's come play some war thunder plenty of UFO's here. But seriously the grind in this game is by far the ♥♥♥♥♥est I have ever seen. It takes sooooo long to get one plane or tank. The game is almost forcing you to go premium just to progress through the tech tree. If only the devs listened to us.. and wearn't a pack of greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also devs the AAA isn't a s500 missile defence system so nerf em a little ffs. I can honestly say that I have wasted 400 hours on this game. So whoever is reading this save yourself the disk space, net usage and time and put some hours into a game that deserves it."

It is not a survival game anymore. Its a clan - KOS - Game where who ever kills eachother wins. The game USE TO be fun. But at its current state is it not worth buying and wasting money on complete udder trash.Goobye rust for now, As i will see you when i next go to the dump."

MDK2 HD,"The base game isn't that hard but is still really cool to play, but to get a really good experience with Call of Pripyat you should get M.I.S.E.R.Y its a total overhaul of the entire game changing things Graphically aswell as gameplay wise, Misery adds a full feeling of every last bullet counts, every Dollar you have should not be wasted and if you wish to survive keep all of your gear in Top condition. Truly an amazing game that puts you to the test with every encounter. 11/10 would buy again."
Shatter: Official Videogame Soundtrack,"when this game first came out i honestly did like it, but now after they keep on vomiting out DLC after DLC i realise how much of a shamble this game really is, graphically it did look nice but the gameplay was pretty standard and the Ai were worse then standard, does it really take a mastermind to make good Ai? cause seriously. DLC Quest legit aint got nothin on Payday 2 its kinda sad."
Shatter: Official Videogame Soundtrack,"Good game if you like robbing banks, killing cops and randomly leveling up."
The Book of Unwritten Tales Digital Extras,"Es épico, épico!!...como el pishi Batman. :)"

Street Fighter X Tekken: Street Fighter Swap Costume Complete Pack,RIFT is a great MMORPG and very fun with friends there are lots of positive and negative things about this game and if you have friends like i said before its great and you should totally check this game out and if you don't have friends to play with i suppose you should check it out if you like MMO's so the final verdict for this game is an 8/10 its a great MMO like world of warcraft and also a very solid game but its not a WoW killer but either way the games F2P so why not and get it and try it out anyways

Ticket to Ride - Legendary Asia,I think this game is worth playing becausNo.1 The graphics is so awesomeNo.2 you can play it on different devices (eg. Oculus Rift )No.3 It is so realistic No health bar It just depends on where you are shooting 
Ticket to Ride - Legendary Asia,"Quite realistic i guessA lot of problems you need to care aboutlike munitions and stuff which would make you crazy so if you dont wanna care stuff like that I recommand you to buy CoH instead of this gameMost of the missions are like the samejust different nation, weapons , etc"

Galaxy on Fire 2™ Full HD,Yet a another bland pile of junk. That's all there is to it.
Galaxy on Fire 2™ Full HD,Nice Banter is bad at fallout 4
Galaxy on Fire 2™ Full HD,A game you can do almost nothing in. Unless of course you have got a licence ;)
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Funniest game I've ever played.
STAR WARS™ Knights of the Old Republic™ II - The Sith Lords™,Firstly im sad saying this but this game does get boring after you play it for 250 hours also dont play alone this game is so very boring when you dont have someone to play with. Second of all I believe that this game is extremely fun when you first start playing because you are in a first person shooter and a class based system which i completely think that is a great  idea because NO one likes playing a world wide multi-player game with only everyone using the same 'class'. Last but not least if your worried about being hacked dont be this game is very secure and believe me everyone I know has never in their life been hacked on this game because it is so secure.-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_Z_k50ltkY

Gotham City Impostors Free to Play: Premium Card Pack 3,"Despite being well made with a fantastic artstyle and interesting core concepts, this game is plagued with no concept of fair challenge or supporting skill over luck, the game is blatantly unfair and punishing, you will rely purely on RNG and very good luck to succeed, nothing to do with player skill, but it's still in open beta so maybe the devs will balance the game later"
Gotham City Impostors Free to Play: Killah Kitteh,"do NOT buy this game, just don't. If you like AC games, play any of the far better original ones, like AC brotherhood, if you are new to AC games, don't let this poor mockery ruin your view of the series. EVERYTHING has been sacrificed to make it co op. Combat has finally been made slightly harder, but is now ruined due to parries and dodges working maybe 50% of the time, and having common street brawlers fight better than an assassin is pretty pathetic. the renowned fps issues and other strange glitches are really just another layer of incompitence on top of the already poor excuse for an AC game. Ubisoft, go back to Brotherhood, everything in that game is better than unity is today, and that game is many years old already"
Gotham City Impostors Free to Play: Steampunk Costume,I think it's a really good game but hell what do I know since I havent played since NBAlive08 it's a decently challenging game but easy to get into.

Critter Crunch,"Terraria, it evolved much, so every major update accours each year, on June probably.This is my favorite game of my life. im glad that i buyed it. it is the best game of steam ( my opinion ), i do play everytimeThis game, is a 2D Sandbox, worth to buy it. You start with an Copper Shortsword, Copper Pickaxe and Copper Axe. 100 HP and 20 Mana. I Can tell, there is alot of youtubers that almost do only terraria videos. Examples: Yrimir, HERO, Chippygaming, TerrariaHelp, meetyourdemize, then others. You can build alot of things, and get even much stronger that you started, or even, get all of the rarest items on the game, also it has support to mods and texturepacks. I Highly Recommend this game to everyone that is thinking of buying or not."
Critter Crunch,"Bom Jogo, parece H1Z1 Com Graficos de Roblox, mas vale a pena, não ligo para gráficos, vivi com Super Nintendo e Consoles velhos. Otima Gameplay, Multiplayer SUAVE.A Unica coisa que falta é servidores oficiais, de pvp e pve. Para todos os países incluindo o Brasil. ( NINGUEM GOSTA DE ENTRAR EM SERVER COM MAIS DE 200 DE PING )"
Critter Crunch,O Jogo Mais ♥♥♥♥ do Mundo
Hearts of Iron III: Sounds of Conflict,"Muito bom adorei o jogo 69/10 melhor que assistir hentai, recomendo mt.NOICE MUSICSZ"
Arma 2: Army of the Czech Republic,Is gud
Arma 2: Army of the Czech Republic,"So this is the first episode of Telltales Borderlands spin on things? I've gotta say.. I enjoyed it. In it you play as two characters, Rhys and Fiona. You then recount events from each of their points of views and play out events in the past, affecting their futures, Got it? Good.Pros:+Good voice acting+Longer length ( about 2 hours and 30 minutes )+More interactive combat sequencesCons:-Too many jokes-Story is all over the place-Towards the end things stop making senseIt's a good debut for a new game from Telltale. If you liked previous games from Telltale you'll feel at home. If you've played Borderlands 2 expect to understand some references."
Jet Set Radio,A terryfying experience gone flamethrower fuel hoarding. 7/10
Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013 Expansion,holy ♥♥♥♥ i actually beat it
Awesomenauts - Expendable Clunk Skin,I liked it.
Awesomenauts - Expendable Clunk Skin,Kill old people for food.11/10
Awesomenauts - Expendable Clunk Skin,This game is great except for one flaw. It's so great that TIME DISSAPEARS while you're playing it so watch out for that.
Awesomenauts - Bumble Gnaw Skin,"STOP! Before you go anywhere, read this. This game is worth playing. Why? Well, imagine this. Your name is Lee Everett. A thirty-something year old man on his way to prison for an undisclosed crime. The game begins with you getting driven out of the city of Atlanta by an elderly policeman. This is a tutorial of sorts as you learn how to look around and click on objects of interest. You also learn about the dialogue system in which you get given 4 options of words/sentences to reply with. Choose as you will, the copper looks away at a bad moment and crashes into a pedestrian, spins out of control and tumbles down a steep ditch on the side of the road. Dazed, confused and hurt you pass out for a few minutes to the sound of screaming. This is where the game really begins. I won't spoil much but this is a really enjoyable game. 9.5/10 is a score that this game earns exceptionally."
Awesomenauts - Bumble Gnaw Skin,"Wow. This game was incredible. Half-Life is a game that came out in 1998 and is the first game ever created by valve. ( The owners of Steam ) It starts off when an experiment goes wrong in an underground lab facility and kicks off from there. Aliens appear all over the place and it's up to the main character ( Gorden Freeman ) to get to the bottom of it, and if possible stop it. It spans over 20 hours of solid all action gameplay that never ceases to be fun. 10/10 considering the year it game out."
Awesomenauts - Bumble Gnaw Skin,"This game is truely amazing. Sure, it's occasionally buggy, and the graphics are rather dated but its insane length and drawing story which involves you making choices that effect the late game is incredible! 9/10 from me!"
Awesomenauts - Hotrod Derpl Skin,"If you are kind of person that likes sci-fi and strategy? Well this game is perfect for you! I really enjoy playing this game so much that after playing I still keep thinking that I was there in the ship itself fighting the rebels, pirates and some confused aliens! Plus the game is cheap. Worth the money in buying the game. Eventhought the game may not have the over the edge graphics but they have their own art style that fits with its gameplay. Don't forget the music soundtrack they are awesome!"
Awesomenauts - Hotrod Derpl Skin,Black ops III is amazing.Pros- Best Movement System in any CoD- With Zombies you actually have a propwe Objective.. Instead of going for High Rounds- You can see your feet!Cons- FPS Problems9.75/10
Awesomenauts - Hotrod Derpl Skin,10/10 Definitely the best Survival Game I have ever played! Pros:- Amazingly Fun with Friends!-A very Interesting and Intriguing Map-Endless Possiblities!-Too much too list here xDCons:-Does have bugs (As excpected with an Alpha Game)-Performance Issues (As excpected once again)

Awesomenauts - Coco Hawaii Skin,"I've had a few hours of gameplay and I heavily enjoyed it but crashes and launcher errors prevent me from playing the game. The game itself is not problem, it's the launcher that can't seem to do anything without getting an error. I reinstalled three times to no avail and it has become frustrating. I would love to recommend this game but until Zenimax get their act together and solve these launcher issues (that have been plaguing users since release) I won't be doing that."
Awesomenauts - Coco Hawaii Skin,All the fun of farming with none of the dirt
Awesomenauts - Coco Hawaii Skin,Fun game but features one dimesional characters and is essentially a Call of Duty clone.

Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City - Renegade Weapons Pack,yeah DayZ is pretty good ;)
Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City - Classic Weapons Pack,"A very nice Hearts of Iron clone, that is great for people new to the grand strategy genre. Invading a country and defending  is really rewarding. Interface is clean and doesn't have as much overwhelming clutter like in Hearts of Iron.The game itself is only $5, if you're a big fan of WW2 history or just history in general, its worth having it in your game library."
Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City - Elite Weapons Pack,"This game is not worth playing anymore, ranking system is ♥♥♥♥ed now, I loose one game and instant derank, weapons have been tampered with too much, smurfs are everywhere etc.Sure use to be a good game, but CSGO has had its face ♥♥♥♥♥ed on for 2016"

Cortex Command,"This game has too much replayability between the rooms, items, bosses, and endings. Much like the first only better."
Dogfight 1942 Russia Under Siege,"This game has become a micro-transaction white fluid dumpster and has lost all its pride. It has given up trying.. Don't buy this game... Let it die.. It has lived too long and it is begging for death.. Yearning for it.. Alas , It has become a shell of its former self and is souless in direction."
BIT.TRIP CORE,"If you can withstand the deaths of a pink haired spoiled rich kid , this game is for you! So many endings in so little time! (Not really, More endings = More time). Death? Betrayal? Underage marriage? War? Poisonous chocolates? WE GOT IT!But seriously though , this game is very dark for its bright cheerful anime vibe. It will make you really think whether you should practice in dancing or foriegn affairs. Every decision you make could cost you your life.Had fun , buy it when it is on sale but not when it is full priced."
BIT.TRIP CORE,I used to dislike this game in Early Alpha but seeing it almost complete and having a revamped design and structure to it makes me enjoy it more. The environments don't feel as tight as they did in the Alpha giving the level design a more open feel.The game isn't as pay to win as it was before and even if you fork over your dough you'll still have to work very hard to make the items you got for that mula be strong enough to tackle missions.There's more stuff I could talk about but Im too lazy to think of more stuff.I'd rate it 7.5/10
Borderlands 2: Mechromancer Pack,Dat soundtrack dough... 11/10 .. would bang again!(Get it cause the gun thingy... ha.. please kill me)
Borderlands 2: Mechromancer Pack,Thought this game was online co-op. It wasn't. Also I am in the progress of refunding this game and lm gonna get 50% of what I payed for. What.Goodbye $13.50 buckaroonies.

Borderlands 2 - Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty,Fantastic survival horror game! Although in alpha it's always getting consistantly updated. I rate!
Borderlands 2 - Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty,"Hard to find a game that gets me hooked these days!As good as it is there are plenty of cons. Lets start with defending or attacking a town, when spawned, you arn't in a small town, you're in an open field map which just takes away the excitement of attacking or defending that town, only when your in a city you'll get your own map and siege battles can happen. The worst of it when defending is even if you have a general setup guarding that town and you get attacked you dont always spawn with your garrison units! they'll just be reinforcements! and at times they even spawn behind the enemy which can completely ruin any strategy, where's the logic in that? i've put 120 hours in this game and played on legendary difficutly and not once when an enemy has my city sieged have they ever attacked, they simply just wait for the attrition to kick in after numerous turns or wait for me to starve, thats pathetic. Chaos Warriors & Blood Pack, Big nono, this is content that should have already been included in the vanilla game! Don't get turned off by comments above, hopfully these problems will be addressed in further patches. Overall it's a good game, and I dont have time to list the pros!"
Sleeping Dogs - Street Racer Pack,I love it!
Sleeping Dogs - Street Racer Pack,"I dont need to review the game because you can see that in the other comments, one thing i will mention, because people always jump to conclusions is how awesome the developers such as Joel Huenik are. Yes this game has been in development for years and is still in alpha, but it's not a cash grab! Visit youtube and search Joel Huenik's chanel, every single week for the past 2 months he has posted videos about the progress and upcoming features of the game while also answering forum questions with a Q&A video. While people complain about it being poorly optimised i have not yet had any problems with it however, A15 is focusing on optimisation while adding loads of new content, the console release was a bit buggy, but the devs have already fixed the bugs but cannot patch it because they are waiting for playstation to give them the all clear, all this is explained by Joel himself.The game is fantastic, and i look forward to every video and every new patch / Alpha that comes out, so if you're into survival games, this is one done right!Check out Joels videos for yourself!https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFrUPm0uNQgiPRos3TYOpEA"

Rocksmith - 3 Doors Down - Loser,"This seems to be an okay skin pack. I'd especially liked the Kold War costumes for Sonya and Sub-Zero, but what bothers me is that Kold War Scorpion is not present? Why the hell is that? There's needs to be an explanation for missing Scorpion's Kold War outfit."
Rocksmith - 3 Doors Down - Loser,"I can't believe that the Season Pass just didn't live up to my expectations. Out of the three DLC packs that come with this game, only the Far Harbor DLC campaign had a decent load of content, that's somewhat enjoyable to my perspective. However, that isn't going to stop me from recommending other people to avoid buying the Season Pass of Fallout 4.When you look back into the downloadable content that is seen from both Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, they actually provided a hefty load of replayability and fun factor with the DLC campagins coming from both these games. It's definately no doubt that I've enjoyed a lot with Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas in terms of the standalone games and the downloadable content.At least for me, I was able to buy the Season Pass of Fallout 4 on its initial price of almost 30 US dollars before Bethesda Softworks suddenly increased the price to almost 50 US dollars for some reason which I don't get.But take it from me, if you are really going to purchase the downloadable content from Fallout 4, it is wise to think ahead first if it's really worth it to consider buying Fallout 4's DLC."
Rocksmith - 3 Doors Down - When I'm Gone,"Fun game for the amount you can get it  on sale, Single player is plain old but co-op is where it gets fun and there are some cool weapons you can craft as well."
Rocksmith - 3 Doors Down - When I'm Gone,Good DLC adds nice easy to use guns but the price is a little bit high

Rocksmith - Pearl Jam - Black,"Absolutely amazing, endless fun and never boring. worth every dollar"
Rocksmith - Pearl Jam - Black,"I Recomend this game to everyone, but I am a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about 1 thing....!I Pre-Ordered this game because I am a HUGE South Park fan, I started watching the show when I was 6 years old, back when it was first showed on TV. This game is made for people who are 18 years and older. The question I have is why is this game a ""low violence version"" it is only for people 18 years and older. I understand its because its pretty full on. Being an adult means you have access to Uncensored stuff, adult movies, guns, etc. But why is this game censored for adults who paid good money for something that should not be censored. The logic makes no sence. Even the South Park TV show is Uncensored at MA+15. Why Censore a game at R+18? This is absolutely Outrageous. ITS SOUTHPARK. COME ON. PATCH IT SO IT IS UNCENSORED!"
Rocksmith - The Police - Roxanne,"This game is SERIOUSLY worth getting. It is the best carnage car game I have ever played. It is really realistic and absolutely 200% fun. If you like to smash the absolute crap out of everything, then this is the game for you. The only words I think I can best describe this game by is. Entertaining, Satisfying, Wonderful. It is awesome. I recommend this game to anyone who likes racing games, and if they love it, Demolition Derby games. I know I barg alot about it, but I only do that because there is a hell of a lot to brag about. And its still being developed. I say good work. I love this game. 10/10."
Rocksmith - The Police - Roxanne,"Alright, lots of hate on this game for being ""nothing like the original Tomb Raiders"". So don't go into this thinking it's like the others. It is a fantastic game in its own right, and imo the best of the series. For $20 pick this one up, you surely won't regret it."
Rocksmith - Queen - Stone Cold Crazy,"Banished ReviewSteam Release Date - 19 Feb, 2014Genre - City Builder, Strategy, SurvivalDev name and status - Shining Rock Software, IndieAge Rating - N/AWorth it? Yes.TL;DRBanished is a challenging (but fantastic) city builder which strays from the rest as it is not your typical city builder; instead of huge capital cities that we see in games like Cities: Skylines, Banished focuses on a small town with a low budget. Personally, I think it is one of the best games in the city building genre. That said, however, the AI of the villagers is rather mediocre, and at the moment there isn't a whole lot to it's (beautiful) bones. This game can provide hours of good, challenging fun, but don't come expecting anything like Cities: Skylines. Also note that this game is very hard, and may be frustrating to those new to the genre, even experienced city builders will also need to have a few tries to get used to it's somewhat complicated mechanics and challenge. Banished has a bit of a lack of tutorials, so don't expect that you will understand everything right away.Banished is fantastic and challenging, but don't come expecting another Cities: Skylines.After many tries and hours of understanding every little mechanic, I have finally formed a functional city with a good population. Yet in this game, someething, small or big, will fail, and everything will completely go down hill. That is the thing with Shining Rock Software's 2014 city builder Banished, there is and always will be an underlying threat. Whether it's famine, cold, a natural disaster, your town will eventually go to the pigs.Your town starts off with a few small, hopeful families, a storage barn, and a stock pile with not a hell of a lot of starting resources. You start off building a few small wooden houses, you make some gatherer's huts, forester lodges, nothing too big. Your town will slowly grow in population and size, and soon you have a city on your hands. However, don't expect it to be a Cities: Skylines type thing where you can just sit back and watch your city work, you need to keep your eyes on the game at all times. One time I had a town-wide famine, because the road from one of the gatherer's huts to the storage barn was too long. Couldn't understand why everyone kept dying of starvation. While it is occasionally very frustrating, it is a very addictive game, and sometimes when everything goes bad the game really shines. The dire need of resources, the feeling of hope, the game will immerse you. So, lets get into the pros and the cons.Pros-Addictive-Challenging-A blast of fresh air-Cool art style and general feel-Interesting seeing your town work and grow from the teamwork of all your villagers-Immersive-Lots to achieve and work to-Relatively simple-Pretty good map generation settings-Weather cycles which can mean life or death-Lots of different ways to approach things; you could use a gatherer to gather food from the forest, use aquired seeds to make farms, or maybe just buy all your resources off the trading post, you can decide-Villagers aren't just lifeless robots, they have needs and happiness which can be fulfilled in different ways-Natural disasters are a cool feature which you need to prepare for-Gives you a good overview of statistics in your townCons-Villager AI is mediocre at best-Not great control over a few different things like villager paths and resource management-Not a hell of a lot on it's bones yet-Lack of tutorials, just throws you in the deep end-UI can be a little hard to navigate-Some resources like rocks are not unlimited, and will eventually run out (this takes a long time though)-Annoying little bugs which can destroy your cityWell, that's basically that. Banished has a fair share of cons, just like any game, but I personally think it deserves a solid 8.5/10It serves as a fantastic ant farm simulator as well, seeing your people evolve and grow, seeing them get all wiped out (fun). It is one of my favourites in the city builder genre and any experienced city builder should pick up this game, but even newbies to the the genre can pick up this game and have fun."
Rocksmith - Queen - Stone Cold Crazy,"Oh wonderful, a glitchy find an object game for 5 god damn dollars.11/10"
Rocksmith - The Allman Brothers Band - Jessica,"Jimmy and Bobby had a bet.""Bet you can't make a game with your eyes closed Jimmy!"" Said Bobby.Bobby was right.But this game is still fantastic."
Rocksmith - The Allman Brothers Band - Jessica,"Surprisingly, it's a really rather good city-builder*disclaimer, long and detailed review, skip to bottom for final verdictI got Tropico 4 in a humble bundle, kind've only wanting the other games in the bundle. So there it sat in my vast Steam library, not really doing anything. And then, my friend told me about a really good city-builder that he had been playing. I thought, ""oh Simcity, right?"" Wrong. He was talking about Tropico, (Tropico 5 however). At this time, I had forgotten that I even had it. So, when I looked it up on the steam store, I realised that I already had it. So, I gave it a shot. And I was quite presently surprised! So, here is a list explaining the good and bad elements of Tropico 4 and there reasons.Pros+Each little person has their own profile;What was one of the elements that made Tropico stand out was the ability to click on every little person walking around, doing there daily routine. Once you clicked on them, a profile of the character came up, explaining their age, wellbeing, faction, name, where they work and where they live. It would also make the camera follow that person. Sometimes, I would find myself just seeing people go about their daily lives for hours on end.+In the population, there are structured families;A little more of a unnecessary part of the game, (but undoubtedly cool) was the structured families. Sometimes when checking people's profiles, you may find a group of people with the same last name. At first, I thought ths was just due to the developers not putting enough names in. But then, I executed a guy, and then everybody with the same last name as him got enraged. Confused, I looked at the effects of executing someone, and it said; ""victim's family will become enraged"" and thats when I realised, there was families, which is really cool!+A system where technology evolves with time;Much like Civilization V (which is an utterly fantastic strategy game), technology would advance as time goes on. This means, that I might start out with some crappy tenements, but when I research more stuff, I could have super high-tec shopping malls. Nuff said.+The ability of extreme POWER;In this game, you have the power of anything and everything on the island, (apart from the rebels, which we will get to later). None of the decisions will be made for you, you have to make them. There are recomendations for what to build, but I mostly found myself ignoring them, as sometimes they can screw you over.+Rebels;The rebels system in this game is rather good. It's simple, when someone becomes too unhappy with the island, they will become a rebel. Rebels can and will screw you over. They will start fires, attack buildings and people and generally become out of control.+Disasters;Perhaps copying other citybuilders, this game has disasters. Dont worry though, you won't be having meteors or aliens or...dinosaurs *cough*Simcity*cough*. Just normal things like nuclear bombs or volcano eruptions or earthquakes. And it won't just be mildly annoying either, it will seriously screw you over. Once, when I built my city next to a volcano, thinking it would look pretty cool, lets just say it wasn't cool when flying blobs of lava engulfed the city and I went financialy in debt.So, thats the list of things which I think are pretty cool in this game. Now, we will talk about the cons.Cons-Limited time;The thing I can think of straight off the bat is that it has a limited amount of time for a game, even in sandbox mode! Sure it is a while, but one time, I built a really great city...and then I couldn't play anymore because my ""mandate had run out"", and that was on maximum time. Sure, it adds realism, but sometimes fun should overweigh how realistic it is. This is where Just Cause 2 shined, now you might be thinking, ""what the devil, what on Earth has that got ot do with Tropico?!"" well, my friend; nothing. I was just bringing it up. Anyways, the reason Just Cause 2 was so fun is that it was completely unrealistic. Tropico should get some inspiration off that.-Lack of help;One of the annoying things about this game is that it just throws you in with ""build a city"". This is a large downside, as the game is quite complicated in the financial part of things. Alot of the time, I found myself looking at my amount of money, going down by the thousands, completely confused why.-Graphics;Now, I would like to point out that this is a very small and minor problem, especially considering it's a citybuilder. But the graphics are a little lacking.Final VerdictSo, we are down to the final verdict, and, if you couldn't already tell with the big blue thumbs up stamped on, I most certainly recomend Tropico 4! Even though it has flaws, I can still say this is a great, solid citybuilder. Thank you for taking some time to read this!"

Rocksmith - The Black Keys 3-Song Pack,"Good game. The VAC errors have gotten increasingly bad though, hard to play now."
Rocksmith - The Black Keys 3-Song Pack,"This game gets worse and worse over time.The developers constantly add new stuff, which allways breaks the previous updates and overall makes the game unplayable.Lets take plasma guns, you used to be able to have +1 overteir guns, about 4-5 of them built around a weak robot. Now that you can't overtier at all, the plasma guns can't do enough damage to be effective in battle at all.  Tis is because of these previous ""updates""1. Damage nerf. (acceptable at the time)2. Damage nerf & removed dynamic airm reticle. (acceptable at the time)3. Damager nerf then boost4. Shot nerf (prevents more than 6 guns fireing at a time (acceptable as it was the same for all guns)5. reloading nerf, more guns equal less shots per minute. (acceptable as you could over tier for extra damage)Now with the no overtier rule Plasma now are completly useless as.1. you can only shot 6 plasmas balls on tier, that can do maybe 4-7 blocks of damage2. if you have more guns it's pointless because they still won't shoot, but you'll lose maybe 4-5 guns from getting shot at while your plasma's reload.3. SMG's just rush you maximising their time at max DPS ripping you to shreads.This update made me un-install Robocraft.Do not bother with even testing this ""free to play"" game."
Rocksmith - Megadeth 3-Song Pack,"This new update, moving from alpha to beta v.7.5 is a huge improvement!Firstly the online survival mode actually works you can actually do the things in the videos.Harvesting and building new weapons, walls, floors, explosives, vehicles is now in the game."

Rocksmith - The Temptations - My Girl,"Rogue Legacy is a really fast-paced challenging but fun game to play whether you're a casual gamer or an addict.So you go to the castle... and die. Then you get to take a pick of three heirs to continue your legacy. You choose a near-sighted dyslexic mage. He dies. Then you choose i gigantic gay paladin who then goes to the castle. He dies. Then his colorblind   dwarf daughter goes to the castle. She dies too! After many many generations of odd-traited heirs, your great-great-...-great-grandson who has vertige and is scared of chickens beats the first boss. It makes you feel AMAZING.After experiencing about 47 generations of heirs i got the hang of the game. You will too.This game is really different from other games on steam. It is a twisted version of a rogue/castlevania game, and the nostalgia will hit you when playing this.I DEFINITELY reccomend spending the $5 to buy this game!!!    9.5/10"
Rocksmith - The Temptations - My Girl,ORION: Dino Horde is by far my favourite MMO to date. I think the idea to the creation of the game was to just put every cool thing about every online multiplayer game and just mix it into a wibbly wobbly ball of awesomeness. a MUST get!!!

Edna &amp; Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes,"Dark Souls IIIAn atmospheric adventure allowing you to have different 3 endings in total.As the Dark Souls franchise has always been punishing if you were to do something incredibly stupid.But despite on how much I liked the previous installments, I do not like this one.The main reason is the poise system, accordingly Bandai Namco / From Software have said it is working as intended.And yet the description of said feature is not how it works.In Dark Souls I poise was a big part of game play, for casters and heavy builds.In Dark Souls II poise was altered to a good degree to make some of the PvP a little more bearable for when a Dex build vs Strength.In Dark Souls III however, it is a completely useless feature that has split the community into 2 fragments. People who think poise was an OP feature for heavy builds, and then the people who thinks it's complete bs.Heavy armor's main advantage was Poise, allowing you to withstand hits without flinching, or slightly so untill you're staggered. Clerics, Sorcerers, Pyromancers and Warriors alike, were all hindered by this change to the 3rd installment.To this degree, you might as well as start off deprived and play through the entire game as is, or atleast use the Master's attire because armor reduction does jack all.I'm am gravely disappointed in Bandai Namco and From Software"
Edna &amp; Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes,If you were expecting a first person shooter it's not. This game gave me cancer

Rocksmith - The Knack - My Sharona,"A FANTASTIC game, even though it's still in development. A great game to play with friends and now they have implemented a single player that is quite fun in it's self. This game has a great future."
Rocksmith - 3 Doors Down - Kryptonite,I haven't played it much. But it seems pretty good.
Rocksmith - 3 Doors Down - Kryptonite,"A very good game, even though it is free !"
Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams,Great game where you jump to the music to avoid obstacles. Also has a Level editor so you can create and share your levels .
Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams,I love GA but it needs Steam workshop compatibility for the adventures seeing that maxis and the Spore servers (For online stuff) got shut down
Tropico 4: Pirate Heaven DLC,"This game has nice graphics, awesome gameplay & a range of different people you can play as each with it's own unique storyline."
Tropico 4: Pirate Heaven DLC,An Awesome Game. You will love it
A Game of Dwarves,Better than R2 in almost every way.
A Game of Dwarves,"Basically Dead Island v2.Better graphics, good voice acting, story just good enough.The parkour system here is on par if not better than Assassin's Creed but in firrst person. Everything is fluid and simple.The combat is less ""rewarding"", the early weapons suck even more than in Dead Island and progression is a bit slow. You're punished via Stamina much more heavily.There's a better leveling system (think Oblivion) you gain XP is different categories as you just run around and kill things (agility/combat/survival), the skill trees have depth.The performance is ok. It gets really bad outdoors (40~) and even those on high end SLI 980GTX's are reporting the same frame rates. Needs some patches for performance, but I haven't noticed any in-game bugs so far.Co-Op actually works. I dropped-in games fine, and people dropped-in mine. Night time allows for PVP (someone can attack you as hunter), but you can turn off this mode if you get annoyed. Online can be set to private, friends, public or off.I haven't played enough to give this a score."
XCOM: Enemy Unknown - Elite Soldier Pack,For those that like the extra dimention for sandbox building this is the game for you. Even in early access as the game is it is worth the investment.
Hotline Miami,"first playthrough - what am i doingsecond playthrough - feel morally wrong for killing, stealing and declining people's requestthird playthrough - getting the hang of thisfourth playthrough - ehhfifth playthrough - don't care for morale anymore, send people on a killing rampage, steal guns, rob food from the elderly, people get sad so i send them to kill more people and rob them from their stuff. having food and meds for days and have a large amount of weapons with a fortified house EASY LIFEconclusiononce you get the hang of this game you start to do a lot of immoral ♥♥♥♥ 10/10 would kill hobos again"
Hotline Miami,teh guns go pew pew 10/10
Sleeping Dogs: The SWAT Pack,yeah
Sleeping Dogs: The SWAT Pack,"For something so cheap, this is well worth the cost. The amount of customisation is unreal, plus it has that addicting sandbox feel to it. Can't wait for the finished product."
Sleeping Dogs: Screen Legends Pack,"Gunslingers itself is fun,I enjoyed it when the matchmaking system actually gave us even geared teammates and opponents (which may explain why we only won two matches) But the micro transactions are too prevalent to ignore. Would I recommend this game to my friends currently, maybe depending on whether they can deal with the micro transactions, would I recommend this game if the micro transactions were removed or even balanced? Absolutely. Hopefully with this game being in early access, they will respond to the community’s gripes with them and remove them, because this game has potential to be good, real good. Check out the full review at http://imagengames.com/gunslingers-mercs-for-sale/"
Sleeping Dogs: Screen Legends Pack,"Honestly, this game was a huge surprise, albeit a good one. I thought this was just going to be another minecraft clone, but the way it looks and the way it runs. Honestly I like it, for an early access game it appears to have a lot of content, and it runs smoothly even on the highest settings for me. Though there are microtransactions at the moment, the devs have already told me they are trying to rethink the way they will do this due to popular demand. I made a video of it, I planned to stop at 30 minutes but I just got that into it that I ended up going for an hour. End of the day I would reccomend it, though I havent tried multiplayer as none of my friends have it... yet :Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6j9mm3Q6cA"
Krater - Character DLC Mayhem MK13,"This game is amazing, you can choose to play it just about however you want, the map is expansive, the enemies are the same strength as you forcing you to rely on skills. Aside from one regularly occuring crash, the only bugs I encounter are just plain hilarious and actually make the game more enjoyable. I only purchased this game not even a week ago and im already at 24 hours of playing I think. Considering the features which apparently are planned, this game will be one of those ones you just wont get sick of."

Beyond Divinity,Fun game but to easy. Recommended to low skill level players.
Magicka: Grimnir's Laboratory,"I have never seen a game like this one before, to be specific where the one who is chosen as the hunted can quickly become the hunter as a lone wolf against 4. The graphical details are amazing and I really enjoy the scenery aswell. Playing as the Monster at first was a little tricky, however once you find a routine you can win almost every time. PLaying as the Hunters, well it is quite literally relying on teamwork to bring down a monster, no mattter if the monster is level one, two or three. But having said that hunters are fun to play because of their 'individual' abilities and I really like the way they have made them all unique in some way shape or form.The only bad thing I have to say about this game is that it's gameplay and styles once you have been playing alot really does get repetitive.To sum this up, combined with the gameplay, the details, the hunter and the monster uniqueness and then taken into fact about some gameplays being repetitive, I will rate it 8/10 and people, it is definately worth trying out :)"
Magicka: Grimnir's Laboratory,Would be great if the game actually worked.
Divinity II: Developer's Cut,very great game buy it!
Rocksmith - Avenged Sevenfold - Beast and the Harlot,"people say pay2win, i say not you can pay to get better but you still need to skill and info about everything to win and get better, just coz you paid for the most expensive weapons, it doesnt make you good, you can easily die and lose alot of money, the reason pets and weaps are buyable because the makers need money, the only reason the old rotmg disapeared is because they werent making profit and eventually needed someone to  buy their game or shut it down."
Rocksmith - Avenged Sevenfold - Beast and the Harlot,"You ♥♥♥♥♥s like to rob some cash? Help some sicko to help his pathetic army?, OR help these people to interfere with the goverment activity?

POSTAL 2,"Decent game. I would suggest even for those who aren't that keen to grab the game when it comes on sale ($3.75) as you can make your money back, just from selling items you get in game for free. This game is what is fuelling my game purchases from now on. Besides from that, it's a great FPS, but is more then just a FPS. It uses strategy, teamwork, and commitment, all of which have resulted in a (mostly) good community. It's also has custom features, so you can choose your weapon skins, and can buy ""DLC"" packs that support community modders.  And to finish it off, it's got continued dev support, so it will (hopefully) only get better."
POSTAL 2,"What a fantastic hat simulator, withy so many to collect, including hats from all your favourite games. You can collect hats simply by killing and stealing other peoples hats, so it's quite easy. Did i say you can also kill people? yeah well thats in the game to but that only plays a small part in the game...."
POSTAL 2,"Brings an economic side to all those strategy games, although it does have combat. Overall it is a good game. Unlike other economic strategy games which are broad (""Build a Farm"" - what sort of farm? Pig farm? Cow Farm? Ladybug farm?) it is much like stronghold, in the way that it is more specific for each category (E.G you can choose a weapon factory, furniture etc.) although that does come at a cost (just like in stronghold) as it limits the amount of categories there are. However this does not impact on the game. Suggestions? The AI is extremely easy, and you can almost never loose an election. Buy this when on sale. Plenty of fun."
F1 RACE STARS™,Good game although it should have a level that is just like the loading screen so you can do it forever.....Oh and watch out for other riders trying to squash your head to take the championship
Chaos on Deponia,"Wow what a great game. Bethesda have kept the standards quite high adding on so much more for fallout 3. Plenty of stuff to get ie guns perks traits armour ect. you will never be bored as there are plenty of quests and many paths that you can take. A must for all, although major amounts of time is needed for this game."
Chaos on Deponia,"Best stradegy game i have played in a long time, especially for a ww2 one . I play it every time i go on steam and although i havn't completed the campaign (because some of the levels are VERY hard, and rely on you previous level) i still love the game....Can't wait till number 2 comes out !!!"
Gemini Wars,Pros and Cons of this gamePros: FreeCons: Update everyday
Gemini Wars,10/10 Best FPS game out there! Used more than $100 for cases and keys only got blues!
APB Reloaded Urban Survival Pack,My name is Mayo but I have Nomayo
APB Reloaded Urban Survival Pack,"This is a good game, no doubt about it. But it is on a whole another level of hard.How hard? Think 2D Dark Souls with a pixelly look and a time limit on each level.Oh, and the final boss is an inescapable advancing wall of doom with 4k hp."
APB Reloaded Urban Survival Pack,"FTL: faster than light is a brilliantly designed, albeit rather unforgiving, space-themed, roguelike strategy game. It may take some getting used to, but if you do have the patience and are willing to repeat events, then it is a must. 8/10"
Magic: The Gathering - 2013 Deck Pack 1,Feel OP as you smash through 500 bad guys while you try and figure out what to do for the mission
Worms Revolution - Mars Pack,"Something about mixing the match 3 of candy that i never liked, with Marvel has created a great game. While it may be wanting you to spend money, you do not have to. And trust me it gets better with the more heros, all the stratergy behind each move. Anyway, if you like match 3 games or mavel this is a great time waster"
Gratuitous Tank Battles - The Western Front,So much fun with others
Gratuitous Tank Battles - The Western Front,"This game will put your swear word vocabulary to the test. Fun and intriguing with a story that isn't force fed to you. Combat is very precise and very rarely feels cheap or unfair. There is large game world with many interesting and breathtaking environments that are filled with a wide variety of enemies from grotesque monsters to heavily armoured warriors.I also liked the multiplayer aspect. Seeing shadows of other players, interacting with their bloodspots on the ground to see how they died, getting summoned to another world to help slay a boss, and getting invaded by other players. PVP battles are incredibly tense, the tactics that worked on NPCs don't always work with players, and you know that the oponent you facing is no novice gamer. Perhaps not as revolutionary as Dark Souls 1 but it's still a very challenging and enjoyable experience that I thoroughly enjoyed.9/10. Death is just the beginning"
Gratuitous Tank Battles - The Western Front,Excellent Game
Sine Mora,"well optimized, Solid physics and alot of fun. If you like to make stuff there is lots of room for that too with importing custom models and such. I highly reccomend it (P.S it kinda ripped of desperate gods http://www.wolfire.com/desperate-gods)"
Sine Mora,Its Cool And The customization is great but Microtranzactions have a high factor in this game SERIOUSLY why add customization if it cost money. yes income is required but i hate it when mt's are in one of the main parts of the game
Fly'N,All a bloody mess (literally) when you fight a black belt while being a white belt i played it for months before it on steam
Fly'N,totaly epic m9k mod goes great with this but it is absoloutly awesome8/10it justs seems to be missing something i cant tell what
Fly'N,(OLD Review)very cool a bit like minecraft but in space and not pixellated and blocky but still the building items are based of a block except some of them.

Clan of Champions - New Helmet Pack 1,this game dosnt let me play you guys need to fix
Clan of Champions - Item Box +,Friend kills me while defusing bomb and steals my defuse. I get revenge by shooting him in the head at spawn. I get banned for 7 days. 10/10 would comp again
Clan of Champions - New Armor Pack 1,"I have nothing better to do with my time, so here is a review for Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit.I'm not gonna lie, but the gameplay is actually pretty decent, you play as a cop driving in your Lamborghini cop car at 200 km/h smashing other cars until they get ""busted"", (which is an overstatement as their wreck of a car rolls over 5 times and off a cliff seems pretty much like murder to me) or as a racer, trying to avoid getting wrecked by the police or other cars and getting across the finish line.The graphics are pretty nice for a 2010 game, the cars look nicely detailed and the shadows and reflections look superb too, the only thing lacking is the anti-aliasing, which kinda ruins some details of the game. The driving in this game feels a bit weighted, and the handling feels like you are trying to steer a bathtub with wheels. The drifting is pretty bad, as tapping the handbrake sends you in a slight drift that sometimes can be hard to get out and send you into a car, or tapping too much or holding the handbrake sends your car spinning out. The driving only missions where you have to do nothing but drive your car to the finish are way too long and tedious, and you will probably spend most of your time doing these, as they take 4-5 minutes, and you have to do them anyway to unlock more missions. After you complete these missions, you may feel like you don't want to play anymore as you spent 5 minutes of your life just driving a god damn car like you would in real life (unless you drive into other cars and into walls), in a video game.Speaking of missions, once you play more than an hour, you have experienced pretty much all what the game offers, except if you keep playing you just earn new cars and equipment upgrades. As of right now, I have not finished the game and I probably plan on not doing so. Also another annoying feature is the rubber banding of the police and racers. You can be as far ahead as you want, but the police seem like they have quad turbos with boost installed and will always catch up to you.The crashes in this game are pretty spectacular, as the game is made by the Burnout developers, Criterion Games and I feel like this is probably the best selling point of the game right here. If you are like me and enjoy watching cars crash in video games, then you can consider buying this game. There is nothing more satisfying than sending a car roll down the road and seeing the heap of metal stop dead, especially if the car costs more than your house.I have only played one game of multiplayer and I have probably experienced half of it. I only found one person (I am from Australia) and I was convinced that he was a hacker. I played as police, and he ignored all my roadblocks and spike strips and literally passed through them like a ghost. I also think that he was using speed hacks and was pretty much untouchable as he zoomed by me. This part is probably why I am going to not recommend this game.  In the start of the game, it asks you to sign up or login into an existing EA account. Me being stupid, I put in the wrong email associated to the account and it made me an entirely new account with an extremely generic name that I cannot change the name of. So every time I want to play this game, it always asks me to sign up or sign in and I cannot get around that other than putting in a fake username and password to ask if it wants to start me offline and it bugs the hell out of me. Also I found out that it  FORCES  you to use a microphone and webcam, so they basically breach your privacy while you play. The only way around this is, is to disable them if you dont want them to be used.I alt+tab out of games alot, and for me, I found out that my fps drops significantly to about 10-20 fps if I alt+tab in any part of the game, even the unskippable intro scene (which is also annoying). I don't know if other people have these problems, but this is a heads up.Overall, the game is pretty decent, good graphics for a 2010 game, one of the best crash physics, sub-par steering and handling and if you find people in multiplayer, (which i doubt) then I hope you have a better experience than mine. This game gets really stale if you play for too long, so I recommend to play it once in a while to get your racing fix. I would probably recommend this game, but shame that these problems had to occur during my playtime.I give this game 6/10"
Call of Duty®: Black Ops II,I love the metro game's and this is a must it feels right and every moment your in the game you feel like your staring in a movie i hope more metro games come out coz if they keep it going like this then im in
Sleeping Dogs: Deep Undercover Pack,for a free 2 play game i must say it is fun i play this alot with my friends and there's alot to do and now that there's a workshop for the game there's alot more to do it my not look like the best game in the world but the gameply is good building stuff in the game is amazing
Sleeping Dogs: Deep Undercover Pack,best star wars LAN game ever
Sleeping Dogs - Triad Enforcer Pack,"Really miss virtual sailer, which wasn't VR but was the best sailing game out there.I jumped in to have a look at VR Regatta and like the other reviews,  I know it has great potential.If this game goes MP, I'm in. Everything worked nice. A bit tiring on the steering as for a tight turn, you had to move the stick a metre but I'm sure that will all change.I got a little sea sick, but nothing I couldn't handle. Funny thing is, I stay on my boat 3 days a fortnight and never get sea sick but some VR games just get to me.Comfort rating would be a 6 out of 10. Great work. Stick with it."
Sleeping Dogs - Triad Enforcer Pack,Love what they are doing with this game. The movements are slow enough that you don't get motion sickness but still get to pilot the time machine like a sub.The graphics are pretty and feel realistic.A controller is the best option for an emmersive feel. I use the Xbox wireless.I will buy this game as it looks like it has a full story mission to follow.You play sitting down so very comfortable for long sittings.Demo is around 5 minutes long.Ai reminds me a bit of portal. Hope thay keep it light and funny.
F1 Race Stars - Music Accessory Pack,"I loved this game. It was really fun with friends, I didn't even mind the microtransactions as much as other people though they are by far the worst point of the game.My problems started late 2015 when I started to realise that my hard drive was full. I do, like a lot of people, have a lot of other larger games installed so I checked them to see if that was pushing me over quota. They weren't. I then checked some of the smaller games, one of which was Payday 2. It now holds the record of being the largest game that i've ever installed, and since every new microtransa- I mean, 'update' they add puts another 5gb-9gb on my disk, I decided to uninstall.The microtransactions, while I didn't find them irritating at first, now they are holding the game down. The GOTY edition helped, but 'helping' a problem and 'fixing' a problem are two different things. On a 75% off sale, the DLC is $33. Unacceptable. Don't get me wrong though, this is a fun game, and I've sunk 257 hours into messing around with mates as a result of that. But the things that turned us away from this game are the over-priced microtransactions, the high file size and repeated broken promises made by the lying developers that we used to trust and respect."
Sleeping Dogs: Square Enix Character Pack,"Its good, I can see its appeal. Its easy to learn, its got a lot of content, its cheap (i got my copy for $1).Do I like it? Not personaly.Do I reccommend it? Absolutely yes. You could either open 2 cases or buy this game. For those who like this type of game, its a trick question. GG"
Sleeping Dogs: Square Enix Character Pack,"TL;DR at the bottom of the page.The graphics are a major upgrade to KF1, not the main point of the game but still nice to have none the less. The gameplay to my knowledge hasn't been changed much, and thats not a bad thing. Solid and addictive gameplay mixed with the graphical upgrade makes for an even better game then KF1.Even though this game is great, its unfinished. My personal favorite class from KF1, the Sharpshooter, isn't avalable yet in KF2. There are also other classes that are new to the game that havn't been implomented yet like the gunslinger that I badly want to try, but sadly they arn't avalable yet. Hopefuly there will be a update soon that adds in new classes, and a haloween sale so I can buy cheaper.TL;DR:Is the game good? Absolutly 100% yes.Is it worth $30? Debatably yes, depends on the date and upcoming sales.Would I reccommend it for $30? Absolutly, but again, this depends on the person.Will I buy it for $30? No, but only because haloween is right around the corner (review written on 24 of oct) and im hoping it'll go on sale."
F1 Race Stars - Science Accessory Pack,"LiEat is an example of a game done properly. I absolutely love it. The artsyle is charming, the music sets the scene nicely and the story, while sometimes lacking, is overall extremely well written. The one complaint I have with these three games (yes, you get three games for $3), is that they are too short. I completed them all in under 4h, and then proceeded to re-play the games a few times to get all the achievements, and for my own personal enjoyment. Fantastic value for the price of a chocolate bar, it's too bad that Miwashiba will not make any more of these. LiEat IV is a light novel that you can find with a google search, but Miwashiba stated that she won't make any more games. It's just too bad that such a fantastic developer doesn't want to make any more. I would buy any LiEat game in a heartbeat."
F1 Race Stars - Princess Accessory Pack,"This little, extremely inexpensive arcade game is worth the entire $3 I spent on it. In all seriousness, this game has been with me for a while and I have gifted it to a few people in an attempt to get the highest score between all of us, not an easy task. This game combines addictive chiptunes with BRUTAL gameplay that will make you want to smash your head into your keyboard, then pick up the remains and stab it. Multiple times. Who ever thought surviving one minute could be so difficult? Obviously not me!Pros:-Addictive gameplay-Competitive gameplay for the highest score in your group-Great soundtrack-Wonderful color palette (in my oppinion)Cons:-Too short-Once the patterns are memorized it becomes significantly easier-I only find myself playing for about 30-40min at a timeRating: 8/10. Easily one of the best and cheapest arcade ""compete for a high score"" games I have in my library to date."

Hitman: Absolution: Deus Ex (Adam Jensen) Disguise,"Wow that was an unexpected ending. Definitely a very intelligent game! Only takes a few minutes (I have 0.1 hours upon writing this review) and was definitely worth it.The less you know beforehand the better the game will be as well, so just go ahead and try it."
The Sims 3: Supernatural,A record number of missing features. The Honest Game Trailer of NMS is actually correct.
The Sims 3: Diesel Stuff,"Amazing game!! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! Not the kind of thing I would normally play, or run into while looking at games but this was seriously amazing."
The Sims 3: Seasons,"Although the game is a little short (I finished in under three hours), it has a lot of replayability as the gameplay itself is really unique and interesting. I also really like the method of storytelling (the game does have dialogue, and an interesting story).I did get the game in the summer sale for roughly $3.00 NZD, and it is DEFINITELY worth it! Possibly the game I'm the most glad I got in the summer sale, because otherwise I probably wouldn't have risked buying it."

Train Simulator: Union Pacific Big Boy Loco Add-On,it alright
Miasmata,Pros:-Great Atmosphere-Great Graphics-Good Gunplay (exept some of the sounds arent that good)-Can run it on high on a mid range laptom (good optimisation)Cons:-The supporting characters are basically tour guides they tell you everything and you can let them do all the work-Some sound assets
Miasmata,This game is one of the best tactical shooters on the market today.
Miasmata,great
Stealth Bastard Deluxe - Soundtrack,Kinda nice but i want new free F2Pand like cod
Stealth Bastard Deluxe - Soundtrack,Best looting GAME EVER I WANT TO BUY THIS
Tomb Raider VI: The Angel of Darkness,:O
Stealth Bastard Deluxe,i really like the but the only problem is the game it's self crasehes when i play about 1 - 2 matches but besides that annoying factor the gmae is very fun and yeah sure i recommend it.
Stealth Bastard Deluxe,^o^ love dis game
GT Legends,"HORRIBLE GAME, DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU DO GET A REFUND, poor graphics, bad UI, if you want a space game based on minecraft get space engineers, player models are ... well Cr*p also controls are pretty iffy and sound is horrible DO NOT PURCHASE sorry developer but i did not enjoy those 6 minutes of play time one bit"
GT Legends,Very Good
GT Legends,"Play this game, do the achievement when u go to first clockworks tower, then u recieve the TF2 hat! The game itself is quite good fun, too. Its free as well, and u dont need money to buy stuff. U get them free as u level up :D"
Trainz Simulator DLC: PRR T1,"This game is Extreamly fun. There are many things to do in this game like, killing/branding warchifes and captains, launching ambushes, riots, and just plain executions. I hope that the game is going to be a series, and in the next game, i would like the ability to have an arena mode, where you fight captain after captain, make your own opponents and re-fight any previously fought warchife and his captains.10/10"

Primordia,do l recommend this game hellz yeah just learn the mechics and away you go...♥♥♥♥
Primordia,"It is a really good game, and i recomend it, but, if you have xp, you still can't run it. XP has a maximum ram of exactly 4 gb, and 1.2 ish is taken up by needed processes, so you have 2.8 gb ram for a 4 gb ram game, and steam won't even open it if you can't manage it. Even if it sais xp operating system, you can't run it. Please do something for this Fun Pimps. Please :(. Still a great game though :)."
A Game of Dwarves: Star Dwarves,"it,s a very nice game it takes more  skillz and how to kill a moving target enemy without aiming as cod sucks take no skills"
A Game of Dwarves: Star Dwarves,THIS GAME IS AWSOME BUT STILL NEED MORE PLAYERS THIS GAME DESERVE SOMELIKE
A Game of Dwarves: Ale Pack,Great game 5 stars :)
A Game of Dwarves: Ale Pack,"An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community.The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot.But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that."
Mabinogi,One of the best ''Boots on the ground'' call of duties out there.
Mabinogi,This is a great game to play with friends.
Mabinogi,"Amazing game, The music fits this game really well.Made me tear up at some points in the game."
Mabinogi,This game is great and all but.. where is the Jumpscares!?
Mabinogi,Great game to play with friends.
Mabinogi,"Lets be honest, you bought this game so you could spell something on your Achievement Showcase."
Mabinogi,"Don't buy this game for $30.Wait for the price to go down and then buy it. But above all, This game is amazing especially the boss fights and the music."
Triple Town,This is So Awesome
Triple Town,A great game that realy supports infantry gameplay but the navel side is dissapiointing
Triple Town,"My older review was '10/10 would bread again.', but i take that back. 2/10 you removed any playability for people with older computers. You've removed the graphics options, thus making it impossible for me and others to play, the tutorial does't work, my game crashes all of the time. I have a new-ish PC, but because i'm almose broke, i have an old graphics card. It works fine with everything else, but with one of my (used to be) favourite games, you, Bossa Studios, had to sacrifice that.Pros--Fun Game-Enjoyable-Good in Early Access-Fun conceptCons--Unplayable for some people-Crashing due to to high of a SET graphics quality-Very low frame rateOverall, I do reccomend this game, BUT don't buy it if you have a less-powerful PC. (These are my opnions, so don't pull me apart like the vultures you are.)"
Legacy of Kain: Defiance,"It took me some time to dig into this game.  The secret is simply it is like real life... band together, use your head, or have it torn off.  Loosing player characters without a reload was shocking but made the game more satisfying.  It makes you plan ahead and more cautious about wading into the sea of S8it out there that you don't know S8it about.  "
Legacy of Kain: Defiance,Loved this game.  First game where the world is three dimensional!  Zombies chasing you? Climb a building!  Just don't try that at night.  Very scary. Lots of fun.
Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver,Incredible.  Worth Every Penny.
Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver,it is not working it gets to a screen and  then it stays like that for 2 minutes and then closes and never comes on it is starting to agravate me someone please help me.

Iron Sky: Invasion,"Nice work Dota , you guys have done a great job developing and updating Dota <     Thank you guys xD"
Iron Sky: Invasion,"Great game, well worth the grind for good weapons/characters."
Iron Sky: Invasion,"I dont usually do reviews, and i usually only do them if a game has either really stood out to me as being brilliant or being absolutegarbage, unfortunatley this game is the latterThere has been a massive ammount of controversy around this game but being a huge megaman fan i thought i could over look the graphic complaints, which if it where the only thing wrong with the game i would, but the game is near unplayable, perphaps its my fault, expecting a true Spiritual Successor to the megaman franchise and getting this, a game that forces you to kill enemies by dashing into them after doing damage from a far (why have a cannon for an arm if i have to get close to an enemy and dash threw them to kill them for points) the lack of a double jump replaced by having lots of jumps where you need to jump dash to get to (not just secrets but linear level progression platforms require dash jumps) the lack of a charge up attack for your hand canon just makes your attacks feel so underwhelming and the character overall feels weak and boring, it really feels like the creators wanted to push this wierd game mechanic of dashing and not focus on what core elements made the megaman tittles greatkudos to the developers for trying something new, but when you're pretty much making a Spiritual Successor to megaman atleast add in some of the things players are going to want from the previous games."
Assassin’s Creed® III – The Hidden Secrets Pack,"Space engineer, it is a clever and creative game. like a sandbox in space where you can build amazing, lager, clever and epic space ships, bases and more! i highly recommend this game to people that like to build. sorry for such a small review its my first"

Rocksmith - Nickelback - 3 Song Pack,I want to punch the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs in the face.♥♥♥♥ the final boss fight and its stupid unfair shadow.♥♥♥♥ this game
Rocksmith - Nickelback - 3 Song Pack,"The slow-mo in this game is really well done, its story is presented in a really nice way and getting to completely oblidarate with bullets is awesome. My only complaint would be the weird sensitivity. And you're in an area with little/no cover, have fun dying. A lot. I mean like, jump onto the ground repeatedly like an idiot to survive."
A New Beginning - Final Cut,7.8/10 too much water.But actually its a pretty good FPS with fun abilitys and a pretty good story to back it up.Winter Blast+Frozen Field+Wrench= Wrench Smashing.

Rocksmith - Foo Fighters - Wheels,Discussion Simulator.
Rocksmith - Foo Fighters - Wheels,"Melhor Jogo de 2014 com mecanicas antigas porém agora renovadas.Um otimo jogo com um clima bem forte de suspence e terror com alguns ""Jump Scares"" , a IA do jogo esta bem ♥♥♥♥ na parte do Alien ele interage muito bem ao seu estilo de gameplay , a IA dos outros NPC's já não são lá grandes coisas.O jogo é muito dificil e cheio de desafios até você chegar mais pro final do jogo que você está invencivel com todos os items porém o jogo te deixa fraco de novo.Sistemas antigos de survival horror como save points (Normalmente presente em jogos de survival horror) Um monstro te perseguindo durante o jogo (Lembrando o Nemesis em resident evil 3) Sobrevivencia entre os proprios seres humanos  (lembrando levemente Bioshock) e mais a sobrevivencia contra os ""Robos"" da nave dentre outras mecanicas bem feitas com gameplay muito bem feito como Craft de items , Hack system , exploração do cenario e etc(Lembrando bastante system shock dentre outros jogos parecidos).O jogo possui muitas horas e cada parte que você se encontra é unico , você tem total liberdade de andar sobre a nave e voltar para abrir portas trancadas porém com o clima tenso da um certo medo de fazer isso.Você irá voltar em vários cenarios varias vezes e isso acaba aumentando demais horas de jogo porém não é um problema.Os gráficos estão fantasticos e a engine bem polida rodando no ultra em computadores que nunca rodariam (Iluminação,Detalhes e o fogo são ♥♥♥♥s).E a melhor parte é bem fiel a o primeiro filme do alien (Alien ou Alien O Oitavo passageiro como é conhecido aqui no Brasil) cada parte da nave está bem igual a os cenarios ♥♥♥♥s do jogo.Pra quem gosta da franquia Alien , de um bom survival horror (que são poucos os bons de hoje em dia) ou um jogo desafiador eu recomendo jogar Alien (no Hard!!!!)."

Fieldrunners 2,"Like every game it will have its Pro and its Cons, Its Up and its Downs and whatever equals Positive and Negative. Bleed is a small 2d platformer where you control the character known as Wryn who wants to become the Greatest Hero of All Time but the heroes have already been chosen so you have to go and kill them and take you rightfull place. It is also a fast-paced action platformer which involves loads of bullets and enemies being thrown at you while you while having bullet time and control over your character at which in no point in time is trying to screw you over. The Game also and upgrades and weapons that you can purchase with points by playing the levels.With everything but the kitchen sink coming towards your general direction it can be quite difficult trying to avoid it and you will die quite a bit at the start (Either I just suck or I'm telling the truth) but unlike most games where it insults you for dying, it doesn't really do it in Bleed, Infact half the time Wryn is actually conforting me for my loss saying things like ""Don't worry we'll get them next time""The Bullet time mechanic is really quite neat and helpful and also quite balanced. There is a separate bar for bullet time: Using it in short bursts will allow it to recharge a little and you will be able to use it again, Use it untill the bar goes to zero and you will have to wait untill it refills again to use bullet time once more and that could involve getting hurt when you needed it the most.I've also noticed the game is very generous in check points meaning it will not send you to the very beginning of that room or level, it's as if the developer knew that it might be a tad bit difficult on players. Now I can't really explain how it all works but just play the game and you will see what I mean.The soundtrack in this game is fantabolus (yes I purposely did that) there is not a single song that I didn't like. It fits in with the enviroment it is placed in and it has that old school 8-bit feel to it, especially the boss music.There is also Co-op in this game, I don't anyone else to play with so yea :C but I had a look on youtube and it's quite nice. Still don't know how it works but it looks good.I have no complaints about this game: It has great fulid control, awesome soundtrack, fast-paced gameplay, a good challenge and a good price. There is however one thing that I am not fond of and that is the length of the game. while there are other things like arcade, challenge mode and other difficulties to play on, I just find this game to be a little to short and could have been better game than what is already was but hey, don't let that stop ya from buying this game cuz it is worth the price.In conclusion I think that this is a great game to play and I had fun every single second of it and for 4.99 Its worth it all the way.........Well what are you waiting for? Go buy it already!"
Fieldrunners 2,Super Team Fortress Combat: Global OffensiveThat doesn't force you to spend your real-life moneyand really fun
Fieldrunners 2,"This is as close as I'm going to get in regards to have Scott Pilgrim vs the World on PC. That being said Phantom Breaker is its own game and what a fun game it is.It's a beat-em up game with anime-like characters and awesome chip-tune music. The Game can be a bit repetive for some but I love it none the lessPros: -Music-Characters: really fun to use and you can unlock more of them in storymode-2D graphics look gourgeous-Gameplay-Stages are really nice.-Multiplayer (haven't really tested it since at the moment its only local at the moment)-Skill Point system-Lengthy: not one of those games you can really complete in one day.-Making combos is awesome.Middlepoint-Later enemies are reskins of previous ones but they have their differences and look interesting. Not just some palette swap-Controls and mechanics are a bit confusing in how they work but it's enough to have fun with.-The Storymode for a single character can go on for a bit, not to long but your hands will get a tad bit tired afterwards.- The game tends to bunch a crapload of enemies into one room and with the weird guarding mechanic working only for some attacks it can get a bit difficult. Still you should enjoy beating the hell out of them with combos.- The Story is bloody confusing for these characters. Either way still interesting.Cons-Remember when I spoke about the whole controls and mechanics thing. Yea some attacks it will block but for bigger guys or stronger attacks dodging it is very hard. Not to mention dodging itself is difficult and you can be beaten the crap out of by enemies. -You will find later on these weird blue/red ball enemies that have these tape claws or something. The mechanics make it either very difficult or impossible to avoid their attacks. That might just be me but its annoying none the less.-You better have a Controller for this because this is one of those games where the PC keyboard inputs are placed in weird places, The control help shows a console controller and you can not change the inputs at all. So yea, Have fun.-Difficulty Spikes on these bosses go up quite a bit and with the confusing mechanics. It can be difficult.As you can see this game has quite flaws but don't let that stop you. I had a lot of fun playing this and with the online mode being annouced recently, maybe soon I'll have friend to play with. It's my kind of game. maybe not to all, but at least to me. Though I would recommend buying it when it goes on sale like what I did.Overall I think the game gets a 7/10. Not the best but no where near bad at all. Bad is not a word you would describe this game with. (maybe the controls but I digress)"
Sword of the Stars II Soundtrack,I could make a lengthy review on how I love this hack and slash game but I'll just sum up what I think of it in one go.I got to destroy an entire army by myself with awesome combos.but no online multi.9.9/10
Sword of the Stars II Soundtrack,While being extremely short (it was most likely intentional) it's.... actually quite good. you do nothing but fly upwards but its quite dramatic and very interesting.I kinda like it.

Rocksmith - The Strokes - Reptilia,"What the hell is Square Enix doing? They make this incredible game that is eaisily as good as (Or better than) the latest Final Fantasy, Murdered Soul suspect or Lara coft and don't give it any publicity.

Borderlands 2: Siren Madness Pack,"Its fun. Very funny, Very short. Simon Amstell is as wonderful as ever.Tightly scripted, very clean, very well executed. Did I mention it was short.. Too short. I want to meet the tiger. Which is perhaps,representative of the developers' anxieties about making a full feature. bahahaha..NO, just a joke. So.. i think i speak for a few people when i say:this is a great intro for an amazing, yet missing Game.At any rate, If you keep making these short things frequently enough,thats cool! i will play them all!More Please !

DmC: Devil May Cry,"This game is fun, I give it that. HOWEVER, this game will not run to a satisfactory or even slightly tolerable level if your rig is a bit higher than the recommended specs. My computer is fairly decent, not the best, but decent. It says that my computer can handle it on the specs info but it doesn't. I recieved constant freezing, crashing and choppy and generally terrible fps (with all settings down the lowest and some additional launch parameters, which was a desperate attempt by me). So if you computer is good, you're fine but please keep what I said in mind. Thanks."

Retrovirus,"Before i say anything i havent been playing this game on steam very much i have only really played it before it came out on steam.I would also like to thank trion for destroying my most loved mmo, and maybe even game.I have logged countless hours into this game with my friend and now they are adding too much.The thing i cant stand right now is the paid classes aspect.Before i would spend hours on end to get that one extra class.Now i have never put my money in to a game, and i dont plan on starting now.why trion?just why?"
Retrovirus,Great game that has physics that really affect your robot in battle though if youre not willing to buy from the robo shop or you cant build then in high teirs youre going to die. ALOT!!!!

Rocksmith - Fall Out boy - I Don't Care,"This game is very exceptional, always rasing my expectations. this would havee to be one of my favorite scary genre games.this game really does scary the living Sh!t out of you, you cannot attack and you have to be on your piggies everytime because you never really know what behind the corner. this comming with no fighting aspect also makes it challenging by thinking of your next move, what to do, and ultimatly should i really go for it?. Cause half the time you dont know if ""it"" is coming behind the corner. Some things i do dislike is the the enemies are poorly done, even with such good graphics, the faces are like a raccon attack there face, then again half the time your running away from them XD. the story is good but halfway it starts to chop and change and it can become confusing, also getting trapped in a corner is a proplem-escape is not possible.even with those dislike it is very good, well thought, and stole my sleep.i give it a solid 7/10."
Rocksmith - Fall Out boy - I Don't Care,"Meu avô fumou a vida inteira. Eu tinha uns 6 anos quando ouvi minha mãe dizer a ele: ''Se você quiser ver seus netos se formando, você tem que parar imediatamente''. Nunca tinha visto meu avô chorar antes, ele percebeu o quanto tinha a perder se continuasse a fumar. Ele jogou o cigarro que estava fumando no chão e falou que nunca mais ia fumar e se esforçou muito pra cumprir essa promessa, infelizmente, três anos depois ele morreu de câncer de pulmão. Foi muito triste e realmente me destruiu por dentro. A minha mãe desde então ficou me dizendo: ''Nunca fume. Por favor não deixe sua família passar pela mesma tristeza que seu avô nôs fez passar''. Eu concordei e prometi a mim mesmo nunca fumar. Aos 22 anos, mesmo após muitas tentações, nunca toquei num cigarro. Devo admitir que me arrependo profundamente disso, porque este jogo me deu câncer de qualquer jeito."

"Rocksmith - Fall Out Boy - Dance, Dance",Essa ♥♥♥♥♥ me fez ter noção de como o tempo e dinheiro são coisas tão faceis de serem sugadas da sua vida num piscar de olhos.
Rocksmith - Fall Out Boy - Thnks fr th Mmrs,"Remasterizado e MUITO bem otimizadoPara começar, a narrativa desse jogo é deveras fascinante e envolvente, o jogador é deixado com o livre arbítrio de seguir uma história não linear (ótimo para aqueles que ficam entediados fácil como eu) e simplesmente partir fazendo side-quests para ficar fodão no jogo. Sistemas de habilidade muito bem elaborados, enorme variedade de armas e modificações, cenários muito bonito principalmente nessa versao atual.Recomendo a todos que desejam um jogo para passar um ou dois finais de semana de BOA diversão"
Rocksmith - Fall Out Boy - Thnks fr th Mmrs,"O que dizer sobre este jogo que ainda esta no early acess e ja parece jogo pronto, durante minha jogatina não contei nenhum bug, ou qualquer coisa que me atrapalhasse no game, e com tantos patches e updates, da pra ver que a produtora ta dando toda a atenção pro jogo. Lembra levemente dayz, só que travado em primeira pessoa. O sistema de armas e munições é um pouco dificil de entender, esvaziar cartuchos, juntar muniçoes, etc... Mas com o tempo pega o jeito, esse é o tipo de jogo que da vontade de jogar mais e mais. Pra falar a verdade, não achei que esse joguim de 10 reais ia me satisfazer, mas assim como How to Survive, esse jogo me surpreendeu, e vai ser o motivo de algumas horas gastadas daqui pra frente!85/100 comprem logo"
Rocksmith - Fall Out Boy - America's Suitehearts,"Primeiramente, não compre este jogo se estiver fora de promoção.O jogo é ótimo,  extremamente envolvente, puzzles legais e história massa, mas é curto. Feito originalmente pra celular, logo da pra completar em menos de duas horas tranquilamente, da até pra pedir reembolso depois de zerar completamente."
Rocksmith - Fall Out Boy - America's Suitehearts,"Lembro-me de jogar na casa de um amigo e falar ""♥♥♥♥ q pariu não jogo esse lixo nem de graça"".Hoje, eu quase que consigo ouvir esse jogo dizer ""Parece que o jogo virou n eh msm?"""
Street Fighter X Tekken: SF Booster Pack 5,"Um jogo rápido, com visual simples, mas extremamente viciante.Boa diversidade de inimigos e uma fase nunca é igual a outra, ou seja, nada de decorar como passar de fase :P Recomendo a todos que tiverem 6,29 sobrando na steam."
Street Fighter X Tekken: SF Booster Pack 4,"this game is amazing, the atmosphere is perfect if your alien fan or like horror games this is for you"
Street Fighter X Tekken: SF Booster Pack 3,♥♥♥ shit up
Cities XL Platinum,I love this game
Street Fighter X Tekken: SF Booster Pack 7,Before I played it I thought it was terrible then I tried and the addiction started. The game is fun but the campaign needs a list so you know which mission to do first because I messed up doing it the wrong way.
Street Fighter X Tekken: Additional 12 Characters Pack,create the most disasterous peices of ♥♥♥♥ to win11/10 would accidentally win again

A Valley Without Wind 2,"Cops a lot but great fun with some mates, I'd recommend if you play with friends and even by yourself it isn't that bad. Comparing to FNAF it's game of the year."
A Valley Without Wind 2,"Build any spaceship/station you can think of, heck you can even build a tank or a solar power plant. Then blow up other peoples creations or just become a massive mining corporation. What's more to like?"

Highborn,Competes with Team Fortress 2 in the amount of time I've spent playing Dress-up unironically.
Highborn,"This game, for me, was a real gem. Admittedly, I am not a big fan of puzzle games that involves a stealth mechanic, but with the unique mechanic that is the 'Crosslink' system, the game becomes a lot less of just waiting and moving and waiting and moving, but instead becomes more like setting up a complex mouse trap that incapacitates every guard in the building with the flick of a switch. And that's where the fun comes from, not the hiding and the stakes of being found, but trying to find the quickest and easiest way to the objective through utilisation of the environment. The story is clever, well written, but short. the level design is top-notch, and with the implementation of a steam workshop supported level editor, I can see a much longer playtime through the various community levels.Oh, and you get a TF2 hat.So, even if you don't like stealth games, there's a demo that you can test the water with. And you never know it might just be that one good game you never see comin.g"
Highborn,"Strangest genre I've ever played, but really cool."
Rocksmith - Kansas - Carry On Wayward Son,Ever wanted to 1v1 a shark? Now's your chance!!!
Rocksmith - Kansas - Carry On Wayward Son,"Good campaign, I would put it up there with the original Fable and DA: Origins. Plenty of sidequests and lore to get caught up in, and a surprising ending. Worth a play for any fan of RPG's; just wait until its on sale."
Rocksmith - Ram Jam - Black Betty,Crashed and glitched on my computer. The settings didint allow for enough change to make it work on my pc.

Rocksmith - Judas Priest - You've Got Another Thing Comin',is epic
Rocksmith - Judas Priest - You've Got Another Thing Comin',"A very fun game.+Graphics are nice+Combat is cute and easy+Quests are simple+Open World+Senarios are just amazing+Stamina, Hunger, Armour and Health Bars+Eating animation is cute+You can wear animal heads-Bug: When i open my inventory then go to map, all of my items vanish :(-Questionable FPS lagI do understand it's an early access.It's still worth getting."
March of the Eagles,"Game is Very good, some multiplayer issues. Mainly lag and connecting but tou can fix your ""Failing to Connect issue"" by verifying your files (it only takes less than a second).Pros and Cons:+ Boss Fights.+ Good amount of weapons.+ SoundTrack is Awesome.+ Multiple types of zombies to kill.+ Character Customization.+ Leveling up system.+ Character and Weapon upgrades.+ Character Customization (Appearance).+ The Sounds in the game are good.+ ""Mystery Fridge"" (gives you a random weapon or meat, or it can just teleport somewhere else on the map).+ Upgrade Machine to upgrade your lovely weapons :)+ Bots are Amazing (path finding for them is kinda strange but they know how to shoot a gun)+ Edit the way the Bots look.+ Achievements give ZKW coins that allow you to buy weapons, weapon upgrades, clothing for your character and more. There is acutally a point to getting these achievements.- 4 Maps only (more will be added in future updates).- Can get boring without friends :(- That weird connecting to freinds issue (which can be easily resolved by verifying files).- Server Lag (when you shoot your gun, the bullets have a second delay before exiting the gun).All of the issues should be solved soonDevs are nice people :)One of them changed my freinds username when he made an error typing it :DI Rate this game a nice    8/10."
March of the Eagles,"Ran straight through The cross fire.....Happily made it through with a MASSIVE hole on my chest and most of my head was gone.Still alive thankfully.Almost made it to a health pack...but before i got there a rouge missle hit me causing my upper half of my body to explode, leaving my bottom half to be contolled by ME XD.But i died after a few seconds.

Rocksmith - Incubus - Anna Molly,"Things you should know about the Cannibals:1. Some of these Cannibals can climb trees. (i learnt this the hard way).2. Cannibals will investigate....3. Cannibals work as a team and will assist each other.4. They can have either torches or flashlights, yes flashlights.5. They are fast, strong and hey can jump long distances (well some of them).6. Avoid them as best as possible.7. If one sees you, attempt to kill it straight away.8. If there are three or more, RUN!!9. They are in groups of four or more.10. They like night walks.And these Devs don't f*ck around."
Rocksmith - Incubus - Anna Molly,"An excellent city builder. No tech tree, no fancy jigamawots to help you.What this game Has and what you can do in this game:> The game has seasons. e.g: Winter, Spring, Summer...> Make a town> Your town will have houses, crop fields, woodcutter, blacksmiths and many more structures> Have to take care of your sla....Villagers.> Villagers will start of as labourers> You can give villagers individual Jobs> Children Eat your food and they do F*ck all (They soon grow up to adults)> Adults will eventually die from old age> The game has a good Tutorial> You have to survive the winter, if you don't have enough fire wood your Villagers will freeze and dieThis game is very detailed. I have survived 8 years so far. IM STILL GOING WOOOH. (ingame years ""duh"").Some tips I find helpfull:<> Roads make your villagers walk faster<> Crops are very good for food but it needs to grow<> If some of your structures are to far away from eachother put your stockpiles in between, so your villagers don't have to walk as far to get to the stockpiles.<> Educated Villagers are more efficient at their Jobs.<> Make sure you stock up on firewood for the winter.<> Place the Forester near many trees.Hope these tips help.If you get this game. The only thing I can say is     GOOD LUCK and DON'T Starve and Freeze to Death."

RPG Maker VX Ace - High Fantasy 2 Resource Pack,"Pretty Good game.Beautiful 2D Dot Graphic, Great system, Little Funny Battle Dialogue."
Rocksmith - Incubus Song Pack,"You haven't played DotA 2 yet? Well, what are you waiting for? Click that damn install button. I could go on forever talking about how amazing this game is, but I simply don't have the time. So what I will say, is that you cannot have Steam, and not play, or at least try this game."
Rocksmith - Incubus Song Pack,"Trine 2 is a beautiful game with truely amazing detail to the levels and backgrounds. The gameplay is extremely creative and that you can do anything using the three heroes, from making boxes and planks to jump on, to grappeling yourself and doing circus acts, to charging your way through boulders and throwing Thor-like hammers. In my opinion, this game is best experienced with a friend. I highly recommend this game to anyone."
The Sims 3: University Life,"It's not so much a game as it is an experience, but its one hell of a good one. A definite must have for anyone who enjoys a great story."
Rocksmith - Blue Oyster Cult - Burnin' for You,"although i currently am playing for 5 hours. This game is good. But my first few hours with it i almost got frustrated with it. spawn camp is a ♥♥♥♥♥, if those that got spawn camp u know what i mean. Still i am kinda sad ther is not much guns to go with but even so there is a ♥♥♥♥ ton of ways u can do ur sessions unless u like a single gun then mostlikely u would stick to the gun for most or all of ur matches. Still i would rate this game 10/10"
Rocksmith - Blue Oyster Cult - Burnin' for You,Hey er what the fk are u doing here.  U came here to read reviews right? if so wtf are u doing just buy this game already.Its has already 133245 reviews go play dam it fk man i am wasting time tying this ♥♥♥♥♥ when i can be playing this game
Rocksmith - Living Colour - Cult of Personality,"this game has all u need for anybody hot looking and strong female main character, lots of killing, stealth though i am bad at it and some puzzle section which again i am bad at and if ur stuck which most of the time i am well google is ur best friend. If that does not hook u in there is also a very ""fun"" multiplayer section which i can grantee that no one plays that mode. all jokes aside i strongly feel that u should play this game as it is really fun to play espically the customisation of guns though sadly cant customise your own personal gun like fallout 4 but however its there.This game is really more of a story base game so if ur the type who like mulitplayer good luck ""almost"" no one plays that mode.still i rate this game 69/10 so if u excuse me i need to use some tissues for something private"
Rocksmith - Living Colour - Cult of Personality,"i swear this game got a grip on me, i tried to leave but but i keep coming back why tera why. Stap man stap making new classes dam it.

Rocksmith - Violent Femmes - Blister in the Sun,The game is great but i wish they would add a vs mode for example it could be a 4v4 and u still would have to build towers but they should add a way to spawn monsters in so they attack the enemy side while u still have to try defend your side. Either way its a very good game
Rocksmith - Violent Femmes - Blister in the Sun,"Although I have not played it on this PC, I have played it on other consoles and friends PCs. It is so much fun building bases and taming the dinosaurs with my friends. The graphics are stunning. Never seen such a outstanding game!"
