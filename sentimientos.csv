2016,"This game is plain awesome, there are so many customiztion abilities. as long as you keep adding addons you never play the same game, this game is especieally good if you like programming since you can make your own huds and addons",2

1998,"This game is amazing. Its a 'Casual' RTS set in world war 2. You have standard infantry, tanks, all that jazz. Community is friendly, and above all, gameplay is sweeter than Donald Trump losing in the election. Here is a moment from my gameplay:'Me': Hey, Asken, isnt that a Stug?'Asken': Yeah, it is. Let me throw a 'nade onto it. *throws AT Grenade*'Me': Nice *Tank blows up*'Asken': Indeed.""The tank chassis that is now exploded proceeds to destroy my squads cover, killing my medic and leaving my squad open to MG-42 fire. ""'Me': SMOOOOOOOOOTH.'Asken': ♥♥♥♥ off.And this is one of the many moments i have had, and will be having in the future. Not to mention the amazing workshop that has a plethora of mods to play and use. Did i mention it has a spectacular editor? Because it does.TL:DRGet this game.+Graphics+Gameplay+Burnt out chassis can kill you and be used as cover-Based on a old engine-Most players use mods for multi-Bots come with the airborne dlc(BS, i know.)",1

2016,"Este e um dos melhores jogos indies que eu ja joguei ( bom tambem e o unico XD ) Tem uma historia incrivel, uma trilha sonora incrivel , personagens muito engraçados ( tenho que incluir o dr watts nisso ne ) Um jogo que muitas pessoas podem diser que deveria ser um filme mais mesmo assim um filme nao traria nada que esse jogo traz pode nao ter uma INCRIVEL jogabilidade mais sua historia compensa uma linda historia com uma otima trilha sonora personagens incriveis eu recomendo MUITO esse jogo eu nao vou mentir que chorei no final do jogo e estou esperando o 2  e estarei de braços abertos para ele . Um jogo com muitos misterios para voce descobrir . Nao assista gameplays se for joga estragara toda a surpresa ( ou quase todas pois tem alguns misterios nao resolvidos no game ) . Nao jogue esperando uma incrivel jogabilidade, jogue esperando uma historia que faz qualquer um chorar , nao jogue sem querer saber a historia que e o foco do jogo voce tem que jogar para descobrir quem foi River Jhonn e qual o passado deles ( na real so do johnn). Jogue com o coraçao. Eu finalizei este jogo duas vezes ( uma sosinho e outro para mostrar a minha prima ) e nao me arrependo e nunca me arrependeirei se jogar mais vezes este jogo esta marcado em mim como a sua trilha sonora.",1
2016,"Adorei o jogo e muito bom, as magias tao com efeitos muito legais.",1
2016,A bit annoyed with the mutli player not being able to have mutli teams but other then that its a really well done game.,1
2016,Hiroshima's Radiation levels are more stable than the league servers on this game :/,1
2016,"Amazing game, lots of fun, blow ♥♥♥♥ up, allday, everyday",2
2016,Its fun,2
2016,"Just freaking amazing. The best game that will keep you occupied for hundreds of hours, with or without the dlcs. It easily the best game of the past decade by far and is a must buy for everyone",2
2016,9/10 this whats currently put out its not so stabe and crashed for me 2 times in 49 mins its probs my computer its so bad but its fun it has a bright future. i recommend you try it,1
2016,"This game is a good mix between strategy and quick thinking, with teamwork being an essential. There are a number of different guns and ships to choose from which can be interchangeable to customise your ship accordingly to how you want to battle (again, teamwork is essential to win). The ships themselves are not customisable(exept the guns) but there are a range of them from tanks to quick maneuvering ones. Despite my emphasis on teamwork and professionalism, the game is not incredibly difficult and noob freindly. Classes can be customised slightly. Alot of games are hosted in the americas so lag may occasionally be bad if you live somewhere else (like Australia) but with a good computer it is fine most of the time.  The only items you can buy are purely cosmetic and do not give unfair advantages in gameplay.Multiplayer numbers:Four people on one ship, need atleast one person on each team to drive the shipUp to 3 vs 3 ship battlesSandbox mode( skill honing, AI target ships) can have 4 people in a game on the same shipSad Parts :( Game can be hard for people with normal computers to play on sometimes. Go check the system requirements.I am Australian :( People in America are haveing slightly more fun with this game.The engineer does not say ""Deployin' a sentry"" when you fix a gun turret :(You have to use a gun to unlock stats in the in-game manuale. Same with ships.Pilot can be a hard class for a noob as the entire team depends on you not hitting that skyscraper or that dust cloud.Engineer is a little bit stressful :(Good game overall, worth getting the 4 pack if you agree with 3 people who have viable computers/internet.The collecters addition adds cosmetic items to the game",1
2016,"While I do not completely regret paying two dollars like some (Seriously it's two dollars, but some people....) I do not recommend the game.I can imagine if you were in the right mood to be creeped out this would make an exellent purchase, but it didn't work for me at the time. The story isn't all that 'horrifying' but more along the lines of 'maybe creepy?;.The game has nice music and good horror creatures. Unfortunately, while the creatures would very work well in a Hollywood film, the games main horror is based off something the game's founder realised when his colleague was drawing on a napkin (true story).The gameplay...is a bit eh. ""the game leaves it up to you to figure out every part of its increasingly bizarre universe"" This part of the gameplay is alright except the game feels more centered towards the story. The controls are good but the actual things you need to do are a bit annoying, it feels like trying to keep a balloon in the air while moving your hands with WASD.Pros:-Somewhat creepy story-The art is alright but only actually serves to pull off the plot twist-The musical ambience is very well made-Tight controls-Nice end scene (gameplay, not cinematic)-CheapCons:-Not really that horrifying-30 minutes long-No replay value (unless this is the only game you own that you like)-Annoying gameplay at points-The game came off a napkin. Again, true story.",1
2016,Downloads a horror mapWalks into the houseTurns on flashlight to see stuffFinds a dead manZombies appear out of nowhereGrabs an AK-47Kills all the zombiesWalks towards a hallwayHears loud screamHas explosive diarrhea  10/10   - Would have explosive diarrhea again.,2
2016,"I remember playing this on the PS1 and it was just awesome. Worst thing of all is I never knew it was available for PC! I've been playing this for a while now and all the memories came rushing back to me. Good times...This is one of my favourite games of all time. I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a good old retro platformer puzzle game.10/10, would say ""Hello"" again.",2
2016,"Recently bought this for custom zombies (because of the weekend sale). Definitely worth it.The amount of custom zombie maps is incredible. There are thousands, possibly millions, of custom maps to play on. The best part is how the game supports guns from BO1, MW and BO2. If you don't have those games but want to use the guns from them, this is the game to have.This has to be the best Call of Duty game I have played so far.10/10, best zombies experience.",2
2016,"  POSITIVES:  Good graphicsGreat campaignAwesome Zombies experience  NEGATIVES:  There are none!Overall, this is a truly amazing Call of Duty game. I would recommend this to any COD fan. 9/10 ",2
2016,"I Recommend This Game  To All People That Like Games That Are About Making A Family Or A Life, Or Progressing Through Life And Geting Jobs To Live And Buy Better Things, Such As, Furnichure, House Aplinces, Your House,And Much Much, Much, More, Just Explore For Your Self!.",1
2016,9/10 would hang my ♥♥♥♥♥ out in public again,1
2016,Highly recomend this game. fun for days and good to play in a group its not really a horror like its stated but its a good survival game. although its very buggy in the games current state keep in mind it is in alpha. it has alot of potensial in my opinion 8/10,1
2014,this game is amazeballz,0
2016,This is a good game for people who like first-person shooters if your lucky then you could even make steam money.there are alot of things to do and my favourite thing to do in CSGO is Casual or Competitive the ranking system can be weird but very complex and well done. there is a large variety of different guns and tons of different skins for those guns but some of the skins are over priced.,1
2016,"I might catch some oil pot heat for this, but it needs to be said.Chivalry, at its essence, is a good game, I loved playing it.Sadly, a combination of questionable design choices, chronic issues of bugs and miscellaneous problems and relatively poor optimisation, are just a few reasons why I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone, especially not at full price.If this game ever goes Free To Play (Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing for Chivalry is debatable), then I would say maybe give it a try, because despite its flawed execution the core concept underneath is good.However, until that day comes (if ever), I would advise you to save your money, and spend it on a title that is actually worth paying $20 for. Torn Banner really dropped the ball on this one.",1
2016,"Dark Souls is, to put it briefly, a masterpiece with minor flaws.It's an incredible game, with an entrancing setting that can be both beautiful and haunting.As you guessed from the title, it is very dark, in terms of both setting and themes. However, it's not pitch black. There's always some hope, or some beauty, or some light that keeps this game from being nothing more than a depressing march from start to finish. The game feels more like 'Purgatory' than 'Hell', if that makes sense. Hope is frail in Dark Souls, but this game will never leave you feeling completely hopeless. There is ALWAYS a way.Finally, the big question everyone asks: Difficulty?Honestly, Dark Souls is not the brutally difficult game everyone tells you it is. Aside from two or three actually tough bosses, Dark Souls is only as hard as you allow it to be, as cliched as that sounds. If you appreciate learning, can think laterally and can adapt to meet changing situations, Dark Souls is a very enjoyable challenge. If you allow yourself to get easily frustrated, insist on blindly rushing things, and stubbornly refuse to change tactics if required, the game will punish you, and rightly so, because you're stupid. There is no ""one-size-fits-all"" plan. Dark Souls doesn't punish ""unskilled"" people, it punishes stupid people. In the first hour I couldn't even kill a pair of skeletons, now I've finished the game. Perseverance is critical. If you're going to think like a loser, you're going to be a loser, it's as simple as that. There will be times when you'll want to throw your hands up in the air. Don't do it. Never give up.Dark Souls is honestly not a brutally tough game. For any Brood War players out there, if you could beat ""To Slay The Beast"", you can beat this whole game,  Dark Souls is much easier than that was.So don't be afraid, don't hesistate, do something positive for yourself, and experience Dark Souls. When you make it to the end, you won't regret it. Also, get DSFix. It's a painless five minute install, and is absolutely necessary for a good experience.PS - No spoilers, but there's this thing called a ""Purging Stone"". You might want to have at least one of those on you at all times. That's all I'm saying.",1
2016,good game,1
2016,"Great game, on some servers the community can be particularly friendly, however on some it is all out war. Building towns, bases and forming clans is quite an incredible experience. And the feeling of your first gun is incredible. BUY THIS GAME!",2
2016,"This game is one of the best games I have played in a while. If you are going to buy it, don't look up anything about it. I promise you that it is worth the money and time, as it will leave you awestruck",2
2016,very good fun teaches stratagey to adults and kids,1

2016,ITs good,0
2016,"Great game, the storyline was quirky and fun, easy to understand the gameplay, interesting puzzles and a nice environment. If you want a fun little adventure then play this game :3",2
2016,Being a 10 year player of this game will certainly be a thumbs up for me but Age of Empires II has been one of the best RTS games ever I highly recommend this game for any veteran players or the newbies!,1
2016,when i start game it says can not connect to master server can someone please help,0
2016,NO,1
2016,awesome game realistic damage die 2 shots love customisation and loadout of weapons and extras 10/10ign better than COD 7 modern ghost warfare 4,2
2016,Good game if you have a lobby without hakers and also you need a good computer and a mouse to play effectively,2
2016,this has been the best survival experience i have ever had. yes there is occasionally bug(s) here and there but othere then that its a great game.,2
2016,A very pretty open-world game and amzing combat and story!!! :D,1
2016,"WELL! If you're one of those people that love to rage and break your headset and smash it on the side of your desk, THIS!... IS! THE! GAME! FOR! YOU!!",1
2016,"Simply everything you wanted in a Action RPG. What makes it great is endless loot combinations. Exciting loot drops come in with regular consistancy and you'll be having to make some tough choices as to which awesome gear you're going to equip. It's well worth the price tag, and generally more fun than some other recent ARPGs, *couch*Diablo3*cough*",1
2016,Terrible PC port of a lucklustre and confused game. Is it free roaming exploration? Is it hack and slash combat? Is it squad based action? Is it an RTS? It tries to do all of the above and does none of them properly.,1
2016,I reccomend this game. Even though it is old it is also very fun. So everyone should start playing this game again.,1
2015,Have played this far more than I should. This procrastination has been enabled by friends.Peer-pressure 10/10,2
2015,"Don't let the thumbs-down misguide you, this is a decent game and an encouraging burst of fresh air even among indie titles. But 'Gone Home' just doesn't deserve your $19.99. I finished the base game in a little under two hours and after that there's next to no playability. Get it on sale or don't get it at all.",2
2015,"First time playing any Wolfenstein game. Throughly enjoyed the silky smooth combat and ran quite well on my GTX780ti. Plot left something to be desired but this is a title among a series dating back to where it helped create the FPS genre. So it's kind of irrelevent anyway.Definitely worth a play, 8/10.",2
2016,"This game has won so many awards and I finally know why. After 3 years, CD Projekt RED have created a masterpiece that will stand the test of time and be remembered fondly by gamers years from now. Cannot praise this game highly enough, the sheer content that is thrown in your face can keep you occupied for 200+ hours. Have to say, I got the worst ending possible and it has had such an emotional impact that I immediately want to start a new playthrough. Please do yourself a favour and throw money at this publisher so others follow in their footsteps.9.5/10",2
2016,love the sound of a well made german v10,2
2016,"So, what are you going to do here? play alone? play with someone else? no matter of how you play, you will always have fun and you will always have something to do! You can pose characters, take pictures, or just do something totally hilarous. The multiple gamemodes help you if you are from the ones that like competitive things or like to play with others. The multiple addons give also extra fun to the gameplay! what are you waiting for? Garry's mod is waiting for you!",1
2016,i think this is a good game but can you guys add a assain class plz.i think this game's vehicles are very nice but i think the flying vehicles's controll is a little bit hard to master.,1
2016,WTF i payed so much money for this bloody game and now you tell me is free???Are you kidding me,1
2016,"The game is good the graphics are amazing but the servers of this game is really sucking ,I've been waiting to play a game for 20 minutes and sometimes you finally find a server people may just leave the lobby or the killer just won't be ready .Overall this game is averge , if only the server are fixed or upgrade to a higher qualtiy it would definitily be a good game",1
2016,Just Yes,1
2016,Dis is an pretty poopy game$2 not well spent,2
2016,"Well when I first saw screenshots of this game I was like ""eh, I don't see what all the hype is for"" but I watched a little playthrough, looked alright, played it for it bit, thought ""this is ok"" now I can't stop, seriously underestimated this game, very, very fun, and the ""situations"" (?) you run into after each jump make this a very replayable game no matter how many times you die",2
2016,"Haven't written a review in a long long time, all of them were jokes anyways but this deserves my time, this game is best described as a journey, a journey filled with amazing music, fleshed out characters (besides Sans and Papyrus LMAO), and an amazing story. I heard about this game through word of mouth and other great reviews, my advice to whoever is reading this is, copy me, read this review, buy the frigggin game already what are you waiting for geezThanks for reading, I'm Tom Tucker",2
2016,Join the ZOMBIE slaying fananza today or become INFECTED your self,1
2016,This game is one of the best games that i have played. I deffinately reccomend it especially if you love stratigy. I love to play this because i love stratigy (without stratigy i would be a mindless thug playing Call of Duty no offence). Me and my friend think it would be the perfect game to play for geography in school because it has some geological stuff in it (don't steal this idea or unless you put my name in for example thank you Ethan/Behemoth for suggesting this). Deffinately play it and maybe even challenge me if you dare and yea. recap Deffinately play it challenge me if you want and watch my youtube (soon going to be uploading Civilizations once i fix my recorder) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB3SBiZrI_bzEb8XUpWpxjg,1
2016,Join The Orcs and fight for victory!!!! This game is Really fun and cheap too,1
2016,This Game is pretty fun for crap quality graphics,1
2016,"I highly recommend you play this game. It exeeded my expectations! I thought it was going to be another MOBA like LoL or Dota 2. No this brought something fresh to the table. It is that good i have already spent real life money on this game (which is hard to get me to do, i hate wasting money on in-game items) and planning to do so again.Add me on smite my username is TheYiyant if you do decide to play hope to see you on the battlefields of the gods!",1
2016,Its a really good game but now i'm having problems and my game keeps crashing when i open any single player world i don't know if its a problem with the games or my addons or both but when its not like that its great 8.5/10,1
2016,this is WAY PAST COOL,1
2016,This game is the one of the only survival games i've played and actually its my first its a beatiful game i like the looks of it the controls and the scary your all alone feel to it when i saw videos of this game i was like i need to get this game so when the steam sale started i got 50 dollars to spend spent it on a few games and then still had enought to get this and i was with a friend looked at the game and was like i have enough money and then i said F*** it and bought it and i have no regrets there still are a few bugs and glitches and if i see any i'll send a report about it can't wait for the full relase of this game can't wait for it to be 10x more awesome then it already keep up the good work  and when i see a reaper levithan i vertiually ♥♥♥♥ myself and i lost a seamoth to one of them and if you were thinking you could train them to be a killing machine thing again they will swallow you whole and may even give you nightmares   12/10 would lose a semoth to a reaper and get eaten again,1
2016,A very good game i like the concept the action and the scary feel of when a shark is coming the guns are good the game play is good 10/10 would get eaten by shark again,1
2016,"A great game and i love it to death like the original killing floor its greatly polished with some bugs/gitches here and there its a great game even with 2 new ZEDS, 1 new Boss, New Characters and Re-Made Characters and some new maps its still needs more but its ok for me how it is and i understand that the Devs are doing there best and trying hard to make more Characters maps and bring back/make new bosses because the game was only realesed in the end of April this Year its a Great game and i enjoyed it and will continue to Keep up the Good work TripWire   10/10 would be torn apart by Angry Flesh pound again ",1
2016,I played this game at a lan party with 3 mates while my while drunk as hell... to this day one of the best gaming memories,1
2016,me like this game i have almost 400 hours 10/10,0
2016,"Quite fun.The PvE gametype is a refresher from the traditional PvP multiplayer FPS, and it's not P2W at ALL.Just remember, jump when you see those orange circles on the ground radiaing out towards you.",1
2016,"I've played this game since it's Alpha stage of development, and I can safely say that this game is awesome. Fast-paced, frantic action, team-based gameplay, lots of player progression/ metagaming, plus MECHS. What more could one want?However, a word of advice for potential gamers in Oceania. Ever since the Raider Update of 2013, Meteor decided to shut down most of the servers in Oceania, so now, there's [literally] only 4 servers left... and 90% of the time, they're empty. So in order to play, you may have to look at another region (Say, US West) and have to face high latency.",1
2016,great game,1
2016,"I bought Shadow of Mordar (SoM) as pre-release trailers reminded me of my favorite game of all time, SkyrimThe game started out promising, the story (ofcourse), plot, initial cut scene and background, this later was dissolved by what seemed to be a frustrating gameplay of mouse-bashing. I can almost guarantee, my wireless mouse battery had taken a major hit since SoM. The re spawn rate of the Uruks and their captains is phenomenal.There was a city which i literally cleared out, only to witness before I exited 50% of the Uruks have resurfaced, on the way out of the city, more seem to be re-spawning and heading towards the city. There is no break, no relief, it's constant mouse-bashing with hardly any skill requirement. I understand we're in Mordar, but the gameplay was just stupid as you just spent the entire play mouse bashing Uruks.Mouse Movement was another failure, im not sure how this panned out on Consoles, but you can increase your sensitivity to 10000 and still get areas of movement where you need a 10ft mouse pad to cater, while other movement seemed to confirm the (hypothetical) 10000 sensor settingVarious ""Power ups"" were useless, one was that you can viciously stab an Uruk with a dagger causing the fleet to flee in terror. I attempted this in various scenarios only the group took one step back, then proceeded to attack as normal.This game had great potential, but also had many flaws which basically dragged it into the abyss of the avid gamer, 6/10 for me.",1
2016,"Great horror game, can get a little repetitive so a new fresh set of maps is ideal.The level up system is trash, i've never been so confused between 2 addons, offerings, and perk system.Major downfall is the match-making system, you can be thrown against a level 39 killer with 3 of the 4 survivors a level 1.",1
2016,"this game does not work not in the way as its not fun but in the way as IT DOES NOT WORK! the ""artists'' dont fix anything they just release more content and they've already made a hollow promis to ''fix '' the problems but dont you think they might fix it instead of lieing and pushing out more content",1

2016,"So I live in Australia, Im in a different time zone compared to the majority of people that play this game so I'm usally lucky if I find even 1 game that has enough players to start. But then when we get to playing my ping is around 400-700, so my experiance isn't as great as it could've been. But still this game is quite fun. It's not really that scary allowing it to be more enjoyable than well, lets just say u wont be goin ""ohhh its 3 spoopy 5 meh!!!11!!"" Its a great game to play over a group skype call, or somthing along those lines.Now the REALLY BIG CON is the games lack of players (atleast in my region) as I stated earlier most players are in a different timezone, meanung i have to up rlly late at night or rlly early in the morn to find a ton of servers. Oh and its price, I feel like at $15 there should be a tad more.But overall if you have lots of friends and arent living In any other country but the US u should get this game.This was a rlly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reveiw ._.",1
2016,"This game is LOUD, would reccomend",1
2016,I love this game it is awesome but teh fact that you need a microsft live account to save the game is bull and it is saying that teh code has been used for another account that doesn't exist as i am the only one that knows the code and have 1 account,1
2016,This game is good i like the fact that it isn't pay to win and you get dragons and weapons that all look cool but one thing i did HATE is after they said it was completely F2P they told me i can unlock everything for $20 which kinda seems like pay to win as obviously some draogns and weapons are gonna be OP and you can get them instantly for only $20 which gives this game a pay to win kinda thing but the game is still REALLY good,1
2016,good game i love but the main problem is that the zombies are so persistan that if you don't have a weapon once your spotted you either have to risk your life and punch them to death or run into the ocean and the crawlers are so damn overpowered they are really fast for only crawling on arms and their hitbox is tiny and they attack crazy fast and are faster than you and the only way to hit them wthout a weapon is to crouch and punch them which most of the time results in your death but once again great game,1

2016,"O Jogo até que é legal mas é muito bugado '-'-Todos os carros do jogo parecem que não possuem suspensão. Se voce cair de uma altura minima com o carro ele vai parecer que está quebrando-Combate meele do jogo BUGADO DEMAIS ! Em algumas vezes a animaçao de bater fica bugada, e seu personagem a executa 2 vezes mas dando o dano de apenas uma.-Inteligência artificial (principalmente dos sobreviventes) Horrivel. Aguns deles te prendem em portas, dificultando sua passagem, sem contar que alguns parecem que não sabem pra que que serve a porta e quebram a janela pra sair.-Para um jogo atual os gráficos sao bem ruinzinhos-Os zumbis e hordas spawnam do NADA. Voce acaba de limpar uma área e do NADA voce atrai uma horda ela entra na casa pra te matar, ou voce pode estar andando de carro e do NADA aparece uma horda bem na frente do seu carro justamente pra danificá-lo (ISSO É RIDÍCULO)-Rifles automáticos não compensam, pois gastam muita munição pra matar poucos zumbis. Já os rifles de precisão são bem mais eficazes pois perfuram os zumbis matando tambem os que tiver atrás e consomem bem menos munição assim como as pistolas e révolveres.-Se o seu jogo crashar pode bugar, e o seu personagem irá aparecer na casa só que com os itens que voce pegou sem ter salvo o jogo. (isso é muito escroto por que mesmo sendo bom em alguns aspectos, voce pode perder carro e missões por conta disso)-Apesar disso tudo as missões são bem legais: Nunca vai faltar missões secundárias (isso deixa o jogo mais dinâmico); o sistema de fortificação da casa e o de confiança que os outros sobreviventes tem é bem legal.Minha nota seria 4/10 pra um jogo que poderia ser divertido, Mas é muito estressante por conta de bugs.Espero que tenha ajudado abraço ;P",1

2016,"I tried to enjoy this game, I really did.I'm usually a fan of chaotic games like this, and I really enjoyed those moments.However.Where this game lacks, is it's platforming. The bosses, the swarms of enemies, the bullets everywhere, I can handle.But the PLATFORMINGOh jeez. I can't ♥♥♥♥ing cope with it. It might just be me, but I couldn't STAND it. The movement mechanics dont work well enough for the platforming expectations it proposes. I died more as a result of losing most of my health trying to jump across a platform while dodging thousands of enemies than from the bosses or the enemies themselves. The amount of times I've done the full triple jump thingy and either flown straight towards an enemy, gone a centimetre in the wrong direction, or spazzed out in the air whilst getting beaten on by a boss, I thought I was going to tear out my hair. It just became too frustrating.That being said, it's a decent game and I recommend getting it. It's not very expensive and worth trying. I'm just generally bad at platforming.(I highly recommend using a controller, that's the only way I could finish the game)",1

2016,"This game is probably my favourite purchase on Steam. A great mixture between FPS, Strategy and Horror, Depth is a great game to play with friends or solo. The atmosphere of the game is great, with the enviornments and gameplay making you feel alone in the vast ocean which is actually really terrifying, especially when your heartbeat picks up when you have no idea where the shark is.

I thought that I needed something more. Something to make the game full.Then I found it. Garrisons were my source for tomato sauce on the battlefield. There were so many metro police that I decided that there was not enough. When I finally decided my troops were ready, I sent them out to my battlefield. At this stage I was getting 6 FPS.Even if it was lagging, I decided to push on. The enemies did not stand a chance.But then something else did not stand a chance against the plethora of metro police I had sent forth. The game itself. I found this amusing and for a mod for an RTS within the source engine, it was extremely well done.",1

2016,"I've only played 30 hours of this, and quite frankly... it is spectacular. It does require some hefty hardware to play the game maxed out (as anyone would expect from a game with a great physics engine), but you will enjoy it. I wrote this review just after the exploration release, and it has advanced space engineers alot faster than any other games in terms of development in an alpha stage (thanks to the great developers). They truly connect with the community, and the modding side is easy to use. The UI can be a bit tough to use at first, but after a while you will get used to it. This is my dream game and I look forward to seeing it progress, and so far, it has done a great job in fulfilling my dream.",1

2016,"While I am a big fan of the AC franchise, and already have a strong sense of bias when it comes to AC games, I feel that AC3 was more of a let down than anything else. While there were some new things that were awsome such as the combat system, the free running dynamics and the open world frontier gameplay, there were still some major things that plagues this game. The first being the VERY long tutorial/training section of the game. Without any spoilers, you almost have to go through Connor's entire childhood before you are really set free upon the world. Also on the PC version, there were some graphical and audio glitches. While we are discussing the PC version, one of the biggest issues I had was how badly optimized this game was for PC. Don't get me wrong, I have a GTX 770 and a 4770K, which are by no means entry level or mid range. However, I still had MAJOR, and I mean MAJOR frame rate drops. I would coasting along at 60FPS and then suddenly as I turn the conner to look at 4 people, BAM!!! 40FPS.In conclusion, I would skip this game I were you. AC4 fixes all the problems I had with this game and it much more enjoyable to play. If you interested in the story, just watch it on youtube.",1
2016,"Visually appealing and intelectually intriguing, Bioshock Infinite is definately a major leap forward from the first two games. It resolved any issues I had with the first two and then some. If you like the first Bioshock games you will love this. Even if you have not played the other games, Infinite will be great fun to play through. Infact, I recomend buying the tripple pack as it is only 5USD more right now (This can change in the future)",1

2016,"I bought this game after a friend I've played many hours of Arma 2 + 3 and DayZ started playing it.If you don't like minecraft, you won't like this game. It's just another block sandbox crafter/builder and I can't see what any of the fuss is about.",1
2016,I've played under 20 hours but this game is incredibly fun. Co-op is where it's at. We've recently got one of the Four player mods up and running and I was quite surprised at the way it handles. Definitely pick this game up if you're into the Baldur's gate series.,1
2016,"Because it's GoT, I'm treating this entire review as a spoiler.I got the entirety of the series in the Humble Telltale Bundle, I'm writing this as I've just finished the game.The game is basically a drama packed, limited, choose your own adventure. After playing on another computer all the way through to episode 5, I had to travel. I downloaded it to my laptop and realised I hadn't signed up for the whole 'telltale account' thing and my save wasn't available.Instead of playing episode 5 with automatically generated decisions (not that they matter a whole lot anyway) I seized the opportunity and played episodes 1-4 with complete opposite decisions as I'd made before. Surprise surprise, not ♥♥♥♥ing much changed at all. It seems, after researching the other endings, you can't really alter the storyline significantly in any way. I mean, if you're looking for a slightly interactive, drawn out version of the Stark storyline of GoT that you'll only want to play once, by all means give this game a try. I paid $12 for a heap of their games and definitely got my playtime out of it, but as a GoT storyline goes it's pretty much a regurgitation of what's already happened in the TV Show / Books, with the same voices but different faces.All in all, I regret spending so much time playing this game that I could have spent playing others.. it's like a bad movie you watch because you need to see if it gets better and ultimately, as predicted, you're completely disappointed.4/10.",1
2016,"Game is great if you're in to the PVP side of all these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t survivalist games out there.Drop in, gear up in under 5 minutes and kill as many people as you can. Australian servers are severely lacking in players on 2 + 5 stack servers, so if you've got a friend to play with be prepared to lag it out on the US servers.CTRL + M, press it when you get in to lobby, for some reason people get a kick out of spamming the ♥♥♥♥ out of voice chat and using police car sirens to ♥♥♥♥ everybody off. CTRL + M mutes everything, press it again when you deploy.Items and skins in this game are ♥♥♥♥ing pointless, there is no spectator mode which would drastically increase my opinion of this game. For example, if you join a 5 player server and you die, thats it. You don't get to spectate the rest of the game through your teammate's eyes, it just shows a camera viewing your dead body.. basic as ♥♥♥♥.I'll give it a 4/10, but that's because it seems to be everything I wanted from DayZ without all the zombie survivalist ♥♥♥♥♥♥ry. If you like that ♥♥♥♥ then shove a tamagotchi up your ♥♥♥♥.",1
2016,"So far I'm around Day 90 in my first playthrough, so this review is based on those first days.The game tells it's story fantastically with a minimalistic, comic book style slideshow. The style of minimalistic art in each cell isn't really for me and nor is the flickering on the edges during said cell's displays, but the story really carries it and I'm sure most people would love it regardless.It's UI (user interface) is a breath of fresh air and a dream to use; clicks are subliminally satisfying, windows open crisply and unlike many management sims you're not bombarded with a thousand information windows and icons to click. The game can be quite slow, but it's made up for by the intricate storyline and the weight of your decisions. It's taken me quite some time to reach 90 days (Time played is irrelevant as I fell asleep late last night, playing it on my laptop in bed) and I'd say it's still got a fair few hours left. This is not a game that you'll finish in a 2 hour session by any means.I'd say it's definitely worth the price, but if you're not a management sim fan definitely get this on sale if only for the story.8/10",1
2016,"Day of Defeat 3, can't wait for the optimized release.I have marked ""Not Recommended"" due to the problems that I have experienced. These may or may not happen to you.Very poorly optimized, struggling to push a solid framerate fps in a Source engine game. I know this is early access, just putting the word out, I've been experiencing some seriously wack fluctuations from 20-300 fps but usually sitting between 50-130.If you can't play FPS's below 144 fps then don't buy this right now, you'll be disappointed.Barely playable for me in it's current state, I will update this review if the game is improved.980ti OC'ed/i7-5820k.Early Access review: 2/10, Do not buy yet.Edit: I have scoured the internet and found that these performance issues do not affect everyone, many people are having similar problems to mine being with 1080's, 980ti's, 980's and 970's, it seems to definitely be an optimization bug and is definitely client side.Further Edit: here is a shot in game looking over a relatively small portion of a map.http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/266095900571329044/2EA75988868CE7B0153485F2FBDC02486A29E4BC/ And here is my 3DMark firestrike score.http://www.3dmark.com/3dm/13873570",1

2016,"Bought this game during the Summer Sale and so far it's been pretty good. Just be aware before you buy it that it is a console port so customization is limited but still quite fun to play with a keyboard and mouse. Also, a quick tip, if you notice screen tearing (where the top and bottom half of the screen don't match up) it is because the refresh rate of your monitor isn't quick enough for the fps you are running the game at. Like I said, customization is limited and you can't change it within the game's settings so go into your nvidia/amd control panel and turn on vertical sync for TLoK and this will match fps with your refresh rate. Hopefully I can help other's with this problem, enjoy the game.",1

2016,"This is an outstanding and Intrigueing in it's ways, but we will never forget Arkham City for it was personally the best and Asylum which was mutinously awesome. There was something new that was introduced in the batman series was the Multiplayer mode. It was nerve-wrecking to play it and it gave a lot of competitive teamwork. It was a legible attachment to the game, and looking forward to keep playing this. This of course has it's downfalls and the biggest downfall was the suit. I mean would that be a bit heavy for someone who needs to be lightning fast? Look at the logic!. Whatever I say about this game, this game may not be as it should be, but overall it is entertaining and fun with full of possiblities. I would recommend this game for any Batman loving gamer out there!",2

2016,"This is an excellent survival horror game, as it manages to keep a suspensful atmosphere throughout your experience and manages to create a very realistic post-apocalyptic city, by uitilizing the use of shrubbery, broken building, crashed helicopters, masses of derelict, weather damaged cars as well as, of course, the players, who mostly seem to be very paranoid towards eachother as well as very distrustful. This greatly helps to create a tense and frightening atmosphere in which the players survive. And one final thing, the nether (of course). They are not only scary as crap in appearance but they can also teleport and are extremely powerful depending on the variety -speaking of which, there are many-. All of these assets greatly help to create a great survival horror experience for the nether game. PS: it is still in alpha, so there will be a few bugs.",1

2016,"This game is fun. Plot and characters irritate me, but mechanics and fighting is fun. My computer struggles to run it, so I suffer from constant slowdown. However, it slows down in a way that it often makes me feel it overloaded on dramatic effect. It makes my casts and attacks come out slower, but it's a smooth slow, so everything feels a lot more potent and impactful than I'm sure it is.",1
2016,"Short game, not a fan of the aesthetic of demonic blugh. The feeling of being pushed around never set well with me in a game, especially in ones that I can't properly vent that frustration on the oppressor.Fun story, this was gifted to me, and at some point, I got frustrated with the aesthetic and uninstalled. Friend got sad, so I reinstalled and completed it. To finish the story is spoiler, but it made me cringe after the aforementioned series of events. I'm sure there's a video up somewhere if you really want spoilers, I just know that every time I see spoiler blackouts, I can't ignore it and have to look at it.As far as bugs go, I can't say I ran into any.

This game supports all kind of gameplay, you can just mess around with friends and gain a good laugh, you can play by your self and feel great when you accomplish a mission, you can play online and meet a great and enjoyable community and the list goes on.

2016,"Sim, esse jogo é uma cópia de agar.io, isso todos temos que admitir. Eu pensei que esse jogo fosse um lixo e seria apenas uma cópia de agar.io. Mas, após jogar por um tempo, percebi que mitos.is é um agar.io com algumas melhorias, como por exemplo sobre o lag que temos no agar.io, isso, o mitos.is conseguiu resolver em parte. Ainda sentimos algum lag, porém, é só algumas travadinhas e também não tem o delay que o agar.io tem.Outro aspecto em que, na minha opinião, o mitos.is ganha do agar.io é que ele tem uma boa trilha sonora, que o agar.io nem tem.O mitos.is tem um sistema bom de lvl e dinheiro, que nos possibilita a comprar novas skins e melhorar nossa célula, dando a ela vários benefícios bacanas, como mais velocidade, área de split maior, etc.Porém, em alguns aspectos o mitos.is poderia melhorar. Não sei se isso acontece só comigo, mas, quando tento mudar de modo de jogo, a tela de loading fica carregando infinitamente e, quando tento reiniciar o jogo, ele continua carregando infinitamente e não consigo jogar. Também há alguns momentos no server que há um pouco de lag, que os desenvolvedores poderiam dar uma melhoradinha né ?Minha opinião final: Mitos.is é uma cópia de agar.io melhorada, que tem alguns bugs, porém, acho que ainda tem muito que melhorar.

It can be played casually and without investing any money in it but then you would be at a huge disadvantage due to the fact that you have weapons that barely match theirs.I honestly tried to get to the max level....... But every time they updated the level cap would just increase, and the fact that you  rank up too slowly without the exp multiplier that the Premium players get just forced me to play this game for hours on end.I eventually stopped at rank 100+ The max rank is probably 235+ by now.The game's matchmaking system is purely unbalanced. If you're a bronze threat player....You basically get treated like dirt and get matched up against goldies, and also.... The backup that you get usually doesn't match the power that the opposition has, unless of course you roll with a clan that's filled with 150+ ranked silvers and goldies.But then again, there are some actually decent people that actually have skill in playing this, it's just a bit sad that the community is just......... But still, I would recommend it with friends, and also don't take this game too seriously",2

2016,이 게임은 너무나도 멋진 게임중 하나라고 생각한다. 우리는 흔히들 게임의 단발성과 폭력성에서 욕을하곤 하는데 이 게임은 담고있는 그 이야기 자체로도 이런 욕을 무마시킬수 있을것이다. 개인적으로는 이런게임들이 많이 나와 게임에 대한 인식이 바뀌기를 희망한다.  작중 스마트폰을 조작하여 플레이를 진행하게 되는데 이는 나에게 매우 흥미롭고 신선하였으며 또한 제작자의 의도를 전달하기 적절하다고 생각된다. 게임의 플레이 타임은 다른 인디게임과도 비교 하였을때 그 시간을 짧지만 그에 녹아있는 주제는 결코 가볍지만은 않다.  짧지만 묵직한 한방을 맞은듯한 느낌이 드는 게임이다.하지만 단점도 분명한데 이는 게임의 완성도에 영향을 미쳤다. 이 단점이란 게임속에 있는 퍼즐들을 해결하기가 어렵다는것인데 어려운 이유는 다름이 아닌 게임속에 힌트의 파편들만 있는 경우가 있기 때문이다. 보통 힌트의 파편들만 있는경우 우리는보편적인 상식(사칙연산-알파벳 순서등) 을 활용하여 퍼즐을 푸는데 이 게임의 퍼즐에 경우 보편적인 것들을 벗어나는 지식이 요구되며이를 모르는 사람이 알길은 전혀 없다. 가령 call의 숫자자판을 찾아야 하는거라면 게임속에서 확인할수있는 장치가 없다. 즉 외부에서 찾아야한다. 이런경우 '흐름'이 사라지며 게임의 몰입에 방해를 하고 심지어 짜증도 난다. 어쩔수 없이 이런경우 공략을 보는등 다른 방법을 사용하여야 한다. 퍼즐의 난이도가 어려운것은 어쩔수 없다고 해도 이게임의 퍼줄중 어떠한것들은 그저 불친절한 퍼즐이라고 생각된다.  이 게임은 멋있는 게임이다. 한번쯤 해보라고 추천하고 싶은 게임이다 하지만 전문지식이 없는경우 퍼즐을 풀기 어려운것들이 있으니 주의하고 플레이 하여달라 (그렇다고 쉽게 포기하지는 말자),1

Everything, from the quotes spouted by enemies, to the intentionally cliche dialogue, makes you feel as if you got into a bad acid trip and woke up on the set of Predator. What I especially love is the weapons; each is, in itself, a reference to a pulp action or sci-fi classic.It's weird, it's wacky, it's totally wonderful, it's Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, and god damn is it awesome.",1
2016,"Jesus, this is a tough one to review.I have extremely polarised opinions abut this game, because the best parts are fantastic, which makes the worst parts even more terrible. The story, writing and gameplay from the original game are back, with some new cast members to either be eaten or saved. That's about as good as it gets, however, because (especially in the second half of the game) the developers seem to have forgotten what made the first one so good.The game is as brutal as the first, but without purpose. In the first one, characters died as a result of your failure to protect them. In this one, people die because the developers said so, and because they want to show how 'dramatic' they can be, forgetting that the key point of drama is audience involvement.The game allows you to brood for ages about whether to reconnect with your old friends, or what to do when your plans fail, and then it'll pull out of nowhere a choice that you can't possibly be prepared for. I remember one particular section in which you have to help one of two endangered allies, but both choices led to the same outcome!I don't want to say that it's all bad. The point-and-click+ style of gameplay is still charming as ever, and there were a few moment of genuine gut-wrench.Just play your cards well when you think about buying this game, and be prepared to slog through some really hard crap to get to the good bits.7/10.",1

2016,"http://blog.blackshellgames.com/2014/04/alans-musings-ftl-advanced-edition-review/When the original FTL was released in 2012, it was a substantial hit with the gaming community, employing rogue-light aspects with the feeling of playing as Kirk or Picard flying your own spaceship through the various charted, and uncharted star systems in an effort save yourself and the entire galaxy. It was interesting, easy to learn but hard to master, but most importantly, it was very, very fun.And now, nearly 2 years after the original release, the developer Subset Games have released a full expansion for free in the form of FTL: Advanced Edition, adding a new race to interact with, a new ship to pilot, a new type of room to utilize, new weapons to devastate your enemy with and a new, sadistic difficulty that the hardcore FTL players will revel in. It’s basically anything you could ever want in an expansion.The best part is, it’s entirely for free for those who already own FTL!For those who haven’t experienced or heard of FTL in the past, it is essentially a top down real time strategy game in which you control your ship and attempt to reach the end of the game in order to prevent the destruction of the galaxy at the hand of the Rebel fleet. You control your individual crew members, assigning them to various posts such as shield bay, weapons bay, engine bay or whatever part of your ship that you want. You then travel through various star systems which contain one of 3 things, an enemy, a choice encounter, or nothing with the intent of reaching the Federation controlled sector at the end of the game to fight off the Rebellion.As it is also a rogue-lite, the game struck a chord with many people, myself included. The interesting game play, the incredible soundtrack and the perfect visuals made the game an instant purchase in my opinion and I spent a large amount of time with the game whenever my internet decided to go down.So does FTL: Advanced Edition justify new people to go out of their way to purchase the game? Well, yes. The original FTL was already a treasure trove of content, and the Advanced Edition adds so much more.One of the new weapons for example, the Scrap Launcher, adds an incredibly interesting dynamic to the combat, acting like a meteor that is able to hit your ship several times, becoming a terrifying and formidable weapon. Similarly, the new alien species, the ”Lanius”: A race that needs no oxygen to survive and drains oxygen from whatever room they are in adds an interesting dynamic to the game. The fact that you don’t necessarily need oxygen in your ship to function is a potential benefit, but also a curse depending on how you manage the ship and other, non Lanius crew members.The new “Medbay” room also adds a different element. Instead of a generic room in which you can send your crew members to heal up after a particularly hectic battle, you have a cloning facility, which allows your crew to be resurrected, should they die (with a small penalty to their individual skills like their repair ability, their fighting ability or their skill managing individual rooms.) This means that you cannot heal your crew in a timely fashion and have to be careful and strategic about when to engage and when not to engage.The new “Hacking” room also creates a new dynamic for the game, with the potential ability of enemy ships to totally ruin your ships rooms and turn them against you, should you not pay sufficient attention to what they are doing. Similarly, the mind control ability is also potentially devastating, providing more care and attention in order to pull off a full run of FTL successfully.However, there are a few issues with FTL. The game can seem incredibly confusing to new players, but this is solved over time with play like many rogue-likes. And although I don’t feel this way, it’s possible that many will be put off by the steep difficulty that the game presents you with.So the bottom line is “is FTL: Advanced Edition worth the $9.99 price tag?”Yes, yes it is. If you happen to even slightly enjoy the idea of commanding your own ship like a Kirk or Picard, you will most likely love this game. And even if this idea doesn’t interest you, there’s still plenty to love with the incredibly interesting tactical battles and choices on offer here and the incredibly replay ability.Buy this one, you wont regret it!",2

2016,"It seems that what they call a 'next-gen' F1 game is releasing an empty game with stripped out features and a glitchy mess.Pros:The graphics are a decent step up and runs mostly smooth on my PC.The handling model and traction feel a lot better than 2014.The new menus are a nice step up from the plain old ones.The sound is improved compared to 2014.Inclusion of the 2014 season.Cons:It is quite clear that some graphics though were given more polish than others. The cars look nice and the night tracks have great lighting but the character models still look last-gen.Not a major con but the commentary can sound pretty forced at times.The AI is a lot more challenging which is good but at times they don't seem to acknowledge your exsistence and are happy to cut you off, clip your tyre and block you on your qualifying lap.I can live with not being able to put my name in on career mode but it seems that all depth has been taken out and just feels like a glorified quick race mode.As someone who does simracing, the force-feedback was pretty lackluster on my G27 wheel.Various graphical and HUD glitches. (Anyone want to race against floating sets of tyres?)I didn't even bother with online but from what I've heard it's pretty broken.I was hoping for big things jumping into next-gen but this feels like an empty and lackluster experience. Probably rushed out to make a quick buck and as the only official F1 game, this is unacceptable. It's not horrible but is slightly above average at best. I wanted to like this game but I couldn't get much out of it. You're better off with F1 2013 which I still consider the best out of Codemaster's F1 lineup.",2
2016,"If someone ever asks me, ""Are video games art?"" I would show them this game. This has definitely been one of my best gaming experiences of 2015... Actually scratch that. One of my best gaming experiences of all-time. There's something about these indie games that are free from the corperate bulls**t. You get the sense that there was a lot of freedom and love put into this creation. Pros + I can not express how much I love the hand-drawn art style. The colours, the lines, they seem so fluent with eachother and provide a great environment to play in.+ A fantastic soundtrack which really adds to the atmosphere of the various locations you visit throughout your journey. + Satisfying and fluent combat with a variety of attacks and combos.+ Most of the voice actors did a great job in getting me invested into the story and the dialogue is mostly well done.+ The well-crafted full anime cutscenes featured towards the end did a great job of setting up and establishing the scene.+ Adequate length of just over 10 hours to complete the main quest on second hardest difficulty and even more if you want to 100% this game.+ A variety of different items you can craft and use to upgrade Fidget and Dust.  Cons - While enemies did have different strategies to use against you towards the end, a bit more during the main adventure would have made the game a bit more challenging.- Sometimes a little bit repetitive which could be solved through more different enemy types.I almost now feel guilty for buying this during the Thanksgiving sale for $3. This mostly solo creation is an absolute masterpiece of game design and is one of those rare pure gems you can find on Steam. I want more! There is so much more potential with this universe. If a sequel is ever completed, I won't hesitate to throw my money at the screen. I highly reccommend this game to fans of old-school sidescroller action-RPG games. This is one of those games you  have  to play.",2

2016,"I'll start this review of by informing people that there is a slo-mo like ability mapped to the caps lock key by default. As far as I know (unless I skipped it somehow) the game doesn't actually inform you of this and I only found out by pure chance when I spazzed on my keyboard trying to get away from an explosion...so yeah there's that.Anywho as far as the game itself goes although I'm giving it a recomendation it is a real mixed bag game design wise. This is probably a game you'll have a love/hate relationship with. Overall the gunplay is great. I really enjoyed the old school twitch based no iron sights shooting and good old fashioned health and armour drops. It's the level design that really starts to let this game down in the last few hours. The first level has you going through a space station with very linier corridors with very little room for deviation whereas the next few levels open up a little more. About halfway through the game the levels start becoming a little too open, with unessessary doors and corridors becoming accessible and some just plain huge open spaces with zero guidence or indication where to go next. This is bearable though and it's not until the last few hours that it just gets tedious. The game starts resorting to horrible half-life like platforming (crouch jump and all) and extremely obscure and hidden paths like barely visible vents and holes in the ground. The end mission is definitelly the lowest point of the game unfortunately. There's also a terrible stealth mission very early in the game but thankfully it's the only one and is over reletively quickly.If you're looking for a game with a cohesive story I would look elsewhere as well. The plot is all over the place and the cutscenes and voice acting are laughable. It's a shame because the game takes you to some amazingly different locations like a space station, gang infested city slums, Russian bases crawling with soldiers and even eventually to Mars for the 'big' conclusion. The amazing variety of weapons is fantastic and they all handle differently making each of them very situational. So in conclusion, if you're looking for an old fashioned shooter with some fun gunplay I would say pick this up. Even if you don't play it all the way through to the boring conclusion (honestly the story ain't worth it) it's still a lot of fun.",1
2016,Great game. I got it on special so it's definately worth it for the price that I payed.,2
2016,Good.,2
2004,"Words can seriously not explain my feelings for this game. First time I played it I was blown away by the sheer mechanics of it. The traps, puzzles and mazes all make up what I have realised to be a game unlike anything else. But most importantly, the combat system. Oh, you would not believe it! This game completely envelopes you and immerses you in the gameplay, making it feel as though you have actually died from boredom!",1
2016,Its definitely an enjoyable game and I would recommend it to people if they had the money to buy it/,1
2016,"I wouldn't be joking if I said this game was good. Its fun, but make sure you have a group of friends as sometimes it gets a little boring by yourself.9/10 would buy all the DLCs (if you really wanna, your cash, your decisions) and Payday's on discount too :)",1
2016,"A nice remake of a classic game.Oddworld: New 'n' tasty:  Is a remake of the game 'Abes oddworld' featuring greatly improved graphics.Graphics aside, This game features a very good single player experience with a good story and solid Action-puzzle platforming gameplay which seems to not resemble any other game i've played or heard of. The game has you roam around as 'Abe' who is attempting to save his fellow race known as the Mudokens from slavary through the use of voice guiding e.g. ""follow me"" or ""wait here"". In order to navigate through the games hostile areas, you must use a combination of puzzle solving and quick reflexes as your character can die very quickly and can only attack through the use of the enviromoment, hypnotising enemies or using grenades and the shrykull ability, and all cannot be used with ease, for example, you can only hypnotise one type of enemy known as sligs and only if there is no sercurity drone preventing you from doing so. as for grenades and the shrykull abiliy you rarely obtain these through out the game and the grenades can only really be used when you are undetected. all these factors give you a unique and challenging experience that most will enjoy.The game also features plenty of secret areas which you need to find if you want 100% completion.When it comes to changes between the original and the remake aside from the graphics and the smooth sidescrolling as appose to screen by screen scrolling of the original, you wont find many differences between the two. most areas remain the same as far as I can tell with a few minor changes here and there that dont make any difference to how you solve each segment of the game. The game does add a quick save feature which you obviously dont have to use if you want the game to be as close to the original as possible. there is also a difficulty selection which changes how much damage you can take but before you panic, hard difficulty does replicate the original games one shot and your dead level of difficulty. The game also features a new voice command ""all of ya"" which simply allows the commanding of multiple mudokens at onceThere arn't really any flaws with the game other than fellow mudokens being difficult to command correctly sometimes and the AI acting weirdly at times.If you're looking for a game that offers unique and challenging gameplay then I recommend this game to you.",1

2016,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the latest installment in the Counter-Strike series. Nothing much has changed in this installment other than updated graphics. Veterans to the series are going to love Counter-Strike: Global Offensive but newcomers... sadly I cannot guarantee that you will like this game. Even if you know you like the game, the very difficult learning curve might get to you before you even have a chance to completely enjoy the game. But it's worth giving the game a shot. To some it's too old school and it lacks features the new flashy modern First Person Shooters have; ADS (Aim Down Sights), Sprint etc. But in my opinion this one of the greatest FPS' out on the market. What most FPS' lack is a sense of competitve nature. Sure you can make bets and ""CMON BRO 1v1 ME BRO I'LL SMASH YOU"" people but in my opinion it's not enough. If you love competitve gaming particually in FPS' then there's another point to Counter-Strike. There are so many things that make Counter-Strike: Global Offensive a worthy game in your Steam Game Library for me to list! So do me a favor, do the Counter-Strike community a favor and pick up this game! For around $15.00 AU (Don't know how much in other currencies, I'm sure you can do the math! >.<) you're getting a good deal! Operations which are like free DLC updates but have limited time on playing the maps that are released in the operation, Skins which are probably the most infectious disease in a game second to the infamous Team Fortress 2 hats! and overall just fun! u2late approves! :DNotes: -Sorry if there are grammar and spelling mistakes!

I recommend this game to veterans to the genre, as new-comers to the genre will feel frustrated. Planetside 2 is no casual game, it's a competitive one.",1
2016,If you played MechWarrior or still do you are going to love this game! Very fast gameplay and stunning visuals. Go and play it NOW!,1
2016,Just realized the EULA is ♥♥♥♥ed up as hell. It's basically Data Theft. I regret getting this game. If you want your data stolen then buy this game! Uninstalling... at least I only got this game for a dollar.,1
2016,"Great for uninstalling!Pros:-There are none.Cons:-It's a web browser game port.-Pay2Win-Laggy-Buggy/Glitchy-CoD/Battlefield Rip off -Horrible GUI -No audio settings...?-Complicated GUIIn conclusion don't even think of downloading this game unless you want to uninstall straight away.

2016,"Unturned is a great mix of Minecraft and Dayz, it's the best of both worlds and also has simplistic graphics so you don't need a high end computer to run it *cough* DayZ *cough*. Not only that, it's also optimized much better than DayZ. You can spend hours and hours of time playing this game without getting bored. I suggest this game to both hardcore and casual players.",1
2016,"This game is worth the $5 dollars! It's like DayZ but without zombies and is a very playable. If you want to play a DayZ like game, then this is for you. It also runs good on very low end PC's if you do happen to have one. Pros:-Runs well on older/lower end PC's-Very playable-Crafting is available-Updates everyday-Very fun with friends-Graphics are decent Cons:-Low player base-Everything is still very alpha-Clunky animations-No customizable settings other than graphics-Spectating after death which tells you exactly where other players are and what they have on them-Many players are Russian (From my experience) and most of them (Not trying to be offensive, yet again from my experience) are very agressive and will KOS. -Server hoppingI recommend you buy this game nevertheless as it will greatly increase the player base and will encourage the developers to keep working on the game.

2016,"Killing Floor 2 is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Killing Floor that came out in 2009. With improved graphics, new maps, weapons and more gore. Killing Floor 2 is definitely worth the $29.99 price tag. So far I have not noticed any major bugs and glitches so this game does not fall into the ""Early Acess"" category if you know what I mean (DayZ). Pros:-Improved Graphics-New weapons-New maps-More gore-New characters-Dosh-More Dosh-Mr. Foster-Sprint-Upgraded ranking system-Perks Cons:-Only 3 mapsTo sum it all up, if you loved the original Killing Floor then you are obviously going to love this. This game isn't just for the veterans though, this game is just freaking awesome and I recommened it to anyone that is a fan of the fps and zombie genre.",1

2016,"If you are a new to this game,  DO NOT BUY IT!  As a long time fan, me and many others have wasted countless amounts of money on this. I made the mistake of trusting Overkill (the devs), and even defending them and their overpriced DLC. I've been blind to it but Overjew are drawing close to the greediness of EA, now, they ♥♥♥♥ed up. Every year in October we have ""Crimefest"" a time where a get a bunch a free stuff throught the month. The first update kicked off with a ♥♥♥♥ poor weapon rebalance, and the inclusion of microtransactions. You now get to open ""safes"" (cases) with ""drills"" (keys) for skins that not only are horrible, but alter gun stats as well (making it ""Pay2Win"") when overkill promised at release that microtransactions will never exist in their game. Overkill also totally broke the use of mdos, gg overkill. A highly ambitious modder was FIXING overkills mistakes, has now had to be cancelled BECAUSE of this ♥♥♥♥ed up update. This game started as a serious fun crime shooter co op game, but has turned into a ridiculous unbalanced boring shooter co op game. Do not buy until overkill fix this. Payday 2? More like Pay2Win or Pay2Day. Fit it overkill, FIX IT!",1
2016,"This game is an almost perfect zombie FREE ROAM survival RPG, yes I said RPG! Almost perfect is that you can be bitten and scratched and recover then the next time you go down, you get ripped in half, you cant really get infected. Anyway, you take the roal (for a little while) who came back from a fishing trip with his friend Ed. When they return they notice that people are turning to cannibalism, but later realise the zombie ""Walker"" apocalypes is among them. They find 4 survivors and do some tutorial missions and they die, you find another survivor, a radio and go to to a church full of survivors. When you make friends at your camp, you can switch to them and gather more recorces. If you are a fan of zombie games/movies/tv I HIGHLY recommend this.",1
2016,"This game is one of the best cyberpunk games you could play. A game that can suit your style of play: Going loud guns blazing? Stealthing around and doing as worst as knocking someone out. Or a mix of both. The story is great but can sometimes be hard to follow, but the big things stick. If you buy the directors cut BE VERY WEARY, the game crashes and freezes constantly if you are running on DirectX11 for some odd reason. If you can put up with it, ill recommend getting it, but if you can't, maybe spend your money on a different game. But know this... You'll be missing out on a lot. 7/10",1
2016,"Ok so, like most people I didn't think much of this game I only bought it because i heard it was good. But to my surprise I was up from 12am to 3am playing it. This game has so much posibilites for stories, dont always follow the main path, take the right door or go turn on the mind controll machine. So many outcomes and endings, secrets and easter eggs this game couldn't be finished in 100 hours of gametime!",1
2016,"I love the fallout series. I was also extremelly hyped for this game. It's incredibly fun, but has its flaws.Pros:- Combat is no longer dull and boring- Wasteland is a good as ever- Addicting for the first day of playtime or so- Once you get the hang of settlement building its pretty fun- Companion quests are fun, as well as getting them all to romace/best friend status.- Power armour actually feels like power armour, not just a bad metal suit. Power armor modding is also worth the time. The mechanic is balanced by having to scavenge for fusion cores to keep your power armour functioning like how its meant to.- Voiced Protagonist: At first the voiced protagonist was hated, the game came out and people thought it was good, now people see it and think; eh. BUT IMO it does express the emotional tones this game wants to portray. When the character is meant to be angry, hes angry, sad, sad and etc. You can hear the emotion in the voice he or her is trying to portray. - Weapon modding is fun, and it does make a difference. But after a while it can become tedious.- Locations and map: The map is big enough is full of unique and interesting locations. One of my favourites is The Glowing Sea, where the atomic bomb was dropepd - Graphics: Personally, I think the graphics are just great but keep in mind I'm running at ultra with 60fps. some people might differ from me.Cons:- Dialouge: At first i didn't think it was so bad, but now I see its a major flaw. You only get 4 choices, which are YES (good guy), NO (being a ♥♥♥♥), Sarcastic (Sometimes ♥♥♥♥ sometimes good) and question? Question is redundant because someone could tell you something about a topic or thing you already know a lot about, yet you still have the option to ""  ""?- Story: No matter what you do, you will end up with the same ending and story, regardless of your choices but slightly different (depending on the faction you side with will determine your slightly altered final mission battle ). No matter what you'll either be a good guy helping people, or a guy with an attitude. No matter what, the game will take you to the same place. The story also feels rushed and incredibly short. Withing your first 2 hours of story or so you're already thrown into power armor, when the other games took a long time to get you into it.  But atleast power armor makes a difference now. With 81 hours in i also cannot find any more side quests.- Replay Value: As mentioned above, the endings and story do not change significantly depending on choices you make. Don't expect multiple endings or storylines like New Vegas had, thats not here. Since the story never changes (just like war), it feels like there is no replay value besides changing genders, the game still would be boring doing the exact same thing.- NOT ME PERSONALLY, but bugs: A lot of people have reported bugs in their game, I haven't expierienced any but always keep that in mind.tl/dr: Most mechanics are improved, making the game really fun. But the story options and ending are just lackluster, when its predicesor new vegas showed how a fallout story line should go (that was developed by obsidian though, not bathesda). Its still worth a buy and play though. Hopefully DLC might fix some story issues, but at least it'll add more things to do as well as other stories to complete and areas to explore. I still very much reccommend playing it because its still a blast to play. 7/10FOLLOW UP:AFTER DLC:So, as you can see, my invested hours in the game has rissen since I wrote this review. My points have not changed dramatically but, I noticed that casual exploring invested me a little further into the game. But, DLC relies on my new playtime greatly. At the moment, there are 4 DLC's. I hate how most of our DLC's are monthly releases and focused on settlements. Before you say ""Be greatful etc, youre getting DLC!"" I personally don't believe, along with many others, that settlement building DLC is entirely worth the money into a season pass. Previously, in the older fallouts, DLC would take 2-3 months or so to release and would be story/location driven, making for incredibly fun quests and senarios. I would much prefer Bethesda to take their time developing more story/location based DLC's, rather than pumping out monthy DLC, with arguably 3.5/6 DLC's being settlement based.  These are the DLCS so far:Automation: Allows you to build companion/defense robots. I say this counts as settlement building because of the building element. This dlc has a quest accompanying it but its incredibly short, its closer to a linear side mission than anything. Robots are fun, but it gets old. 6.5/10Wasteland workshop: Build arena's, concrete structures and have settlers fight animals or each other. This dlc is ok, I'd say its only worth it if you want a gorilla or deathclaw or another creature patrolling your settlement. Tbh, this feels more like a mod than DLC. Should be free, its good for concrete and creatures. Average, 5/10Far Harbor: This... This is what DLC should be. A brand new location, weapons story, side missions, interesting characters, locations and quests. This is arguably better than the main story due to all of the possible choices you can make within this DLC. This DLC is incredibly worth it and I pray to god Nuka world either succeed this or be on par. Definately a 8.5/10Contraptions: TBC *Seems alright I guess, idk what ill need a conver belt for. Also, elevators seem to be the only realisticly cool thing*Vault Building: TBC *Initial thoughts: the idea is cool, however it is basically fallout shelter in fallout 4. I dont really have a problem with it besides the fact it just doesnt make sence to me. This kinda seems like a gimmick, arguably building things is way to simple but wood and metal you can get away with. Just building vaults outta some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ materials just doesnt seem right to me*Nuka world:  TBC *Inital thoughts: New map, new story, with the option of being evil WITH an effect on the commonwealth?? Sign me up*MODS:Yeah, they basically improve the game to your liking. Can't say much else besides it more than likely will add a lot of hours to your playtime.",1
2016,"This is such an addicting game. It's definately worth $10. The graphics are unique for pixel art. The monster log is a very cool addition, as it has detailed pixel art pictures of each monster and provideds a bit of lore. Risk of Rain has an amazing soundtrack, I'm planning on buying it soon. I rate this game 9.5/10 :3",2
2016,"Keeping with the happy reviews as another indie game I have played, has not dissapointed. Home is a short, pixelated, side scrolling horror game, which is based heavily on reading and exploration. Given the details mentioned this game is surely not for everyone, but putting that aside, why is it good?Home is a very atmospheric game, giving players just ambience to listen to throughout the 1 hour long experience (I use this word instead of game on purpose), the story follows a man who has woken up in a strange, unkown place, and is set the main obkective of returning home, to find his wife. As you get closer to home the story delves deeper and more questions arise, finding strange objects and horrifying scenarios, but maintaining zero jump scares.Home was enjoyable to play, being a game I could start and finish in one sitting, but as stated earlier there is no really exciting gameplay, but more of a filmic experience. I give Home 6/10",1
2016,"Evoland, when asked to sum it up, I would say, is fairly hard to do. It is a great indie game that changes, evolves and develops as  you play it, starting as a black and white, 2D adventure game like the original Legend of Zelda, and developing into a fully coloured, 3D, free roam, adventure RPG more like Final Fantasy. The game is enjoyable, short and funny and has a great soundtrack, I would definitely recomend this game to lovers of old adventure games and whom want to relive their history and all the changes they have gone through to become what they are today.Thanks for reading, Jazza.",1
2016,"Gunpoint is the most fitting representation of why I personally love to buy indie games over mainstream ones. It has to be one of the most enjoyable, interesting and funny games I have ever played.The game hosts a unique style and gameplay, along with a great mystery soundtrack and lovable protagonist, not to mention puzzles that can be solved in a variety of ways and are satisfying to complete. The story itself is a classic murder mystery that isn't too heavy so you don't need to worry about forgetting key points, with the main character being a shadey yet hilarious detective who recently gained the ability to jump buildings thanks to the designer bull frog pants.Gunpoint is a unique and extremely enjoyable game to play, and definitely recommend anyone reading this review to buy it, or play it again :] 10/10",1
2016,"This game justifies that video games are one of the best methods of story-telling if done right, and Gone Home does it SO right. People are fair in saying that this is not really a game, and more of an exploratory, audio visual experience, for lack of a shorter, better phrase. With Gone Home's main gameplay aspect being exploration, it makes it so enjoyable to walk around a house and look at things while slowly uncovering a deep story of how your sister slowly discovers who she really is. I usually wouldn't label anything as cute, but the ending definely deserves something of the sort.Other than that, the developers have done so well at creating an eerie atmosphere to keep you on the edge of your seat, in preparation for anything that may happen, with mention of ghosts and exorcisms, and the chilling, storm constantly raging outside, This game manages to be scary in a way, without having anything scary happen.This game is purely amazing, it has a great story, and a sweet soundtrack, plus with it being set 90s I got a huge feeling of early childhood sort of thing going on. It was an awesome game, go play it. 9/10",1
2016,"I really like indie games, so when I saw this I thought that the concept was amazing, and it really is, but the fact that it is an indie game is the reason it could do with some work, the soundtrack and style of the game are mesmerizing and the character design has been done well, that's all good. Then there are the aspects that need tweaking, the shadow jumping, platforming and the AI aren't all that good. When attempting to scale or run a wall, the game is too unforgiving, basiclly you get caught on all the little details of a shadow, which may make it seem realistic but no. it gets frustrating. The platforming is also, of course, based around the shadow dimension so you can already guess what I would of said there, another big annoyance is that even though solid objects wouldn't hypothetically affect the dimension of a shadow, in the game, for example, if you try to walk past a pillar on the wall you will generally get thrown out of the shadow world. The last complaint is about the lack of AI for Didi, your young, female companion, whenever travelling from one mission area to another, she will walk exactly where she is programmed to and then stand there for as long as it takes you to get there, making no comments or attempt to follow you around while you search for collectibles (a main feature in the game) or admire the scenery. All together this game is a little expensive for $15, it was a great puzzle experience with an excellent soundtrack and an amazing ending, but for $15 it seems a little expensive. I would give this game an 8/10 and send a request to rename it ""Contrast: Prepare to Die Edition""",1
2016,"Supergiant Games have a reputation from their previous game Bastion, to create strong stories that host powerful soundtracks and detailed art. Transistor is no dissapointment, this game is huge step up from Bastion, showcasing unique gameplay mechanics, with a fully customizable weapon at hand. Though this is one of the biggest feautres of the game, the story, soundtrack, design and love for the characters in the game got me through to the end. This game has such a deep story of lost love and the struggles to reunite with that one. Not only is the soundtrack well written and fitting with the game, it flows with the story development and events that occur through your playthrough, the stylised art is painstakingly detailed, and geometrically themed to maintain the futuristic feel in cloud bank.Though there were few flaws, some people may find the combat mechanic a bit repetitive, though that is merely encouragement to mix the Transistor's abilities around for a different approach during conflict.The story is well written and heartfelt, while keeping soppiness out of the picture, beginning in the middle of initial conflict, which renders the protagonist unable to speak her mind and leaves the player to discover hidden details along the way, giving a satisfying and over all great ending. If I were to give this game a rating it would have to be 9/10 just because no game is perfect, but this cut so close, I love having a game the doesn't prolong important story development and yet still tells it powerfully, as well as the art and soundtrack winning me over, a truly moving game.9/10",1
2016,"Not only is this movie an inspiring documentary about several of the best indie developers out there, but it's an hour and a half long journey which you take as a viewer with the people that are in it, becoming truly sympathetic for their hardships, and joyful for their successes.This film is overall engaging and informative (and I don't think I can say enough positive feedback to get my point across but I'll try), telling the story of the developers of three different indie games, Braid, FEZ and Super Meat Boy. During which you watch the production of the game, the struggles and the achievments along the way, as well as how stepping into such a large project affects their social lives, relationships, health and day to day routines, and really gives you a good idea of how hard indie devs work to produce the games they do.The movie is super enjoyable to watch, has a great soundtrack and has won a bunch of awards, so please just buy it and watch it because you won't regret experiencing what you do while watching this. serious.",1
2016,"With the Portal games being one of the most popular action puzzle series in history, the new indie release Aperture Tag had a lot to live up to in several respects, both original games showcased a unique futuristic soundtrack, difficult puzzles and of course the memorable commentary of one special AI that has a place in all of our hearts.Aperture Tag ticks these boxes, but not as well as the original series did. Of course, being an indie title I should cut it some slack. The game has a great overall soundtrack which hardly differs from the original's in style, keeping the ominous electronic feel which all players of the original relate to solving puzzles with (listening to it as I write this).The puzzles themselves are well crafted and make good use of the new device we hold in Painter Chell's hands (check out her model in one of the tests involving portals), including several race track themed courses which rely on reaction time to pass, and others which have a series of walls and levels which are needed to bouce and run off of to continue.The only ingredient this game seemed to miss from the delicious cake this series is was its AI character, Nigel, a personality core running his first test with you. Though the game didn't attempt to compete with Glad0s, it lacked in overall comedic value which I remember the first two games for having.This game is great for an indie release attempting to prequel/sequel the other two games which will always be a difficult thing to do, its soundtrack and puzzles are on portal point, and as much as Nigel is a lovable orb of metal, he didn't cut it for me. I missed Glad0s and her odd ramblings, attempts to kill me and her unique personality, I am yet to try out the cooperative and map creation modes featured in this game, but am glad I purchased this, and thoroughly enjoyed playing it.",1

2016,"Skip this if you guys want:You crash in a distant planet alone, scared and powerless. It seems hopeless, but you find your weapons intact and functional. You search the skies for a chance to see another life pod. A chance for someone to be with you, A chance to survive, but you only see storage units falling you say' ""Must of been from the ship"". Alas, hopelessness grips you again. You shout of sorrow, not because of not seeing another life pod from the ship, but because knowing your the only one that survived and with what you have seen, the ship must of been destroyed. You place your weapon on your head knowing there is no chance of survival and prepared to shoot, but wait?!?!? You see the ship landing 10 miles away. With new found hope you ready your weapons and journey through this God forsaken planet. You start with the Commando. A very agile and powerful character if matched with the right items. With him you'll learn how to kite, how to dodge and how every damage to an enemy counts. Gameplay is smooth and fun. Controls are quite simple. It's an addictive game and has great replay value.The music is fantastic. It has achivements that you need to unlock for new items or characters (Yes I'm looking at you achievement hunters). You can choose from 10 different characters (If you unlock them all that is) and not every run is the same. But a few achievements based items are impossible to get and multiplayer is buggy. Most new player will completely lost on what to do and die in the 10 min mark. I wouldn't recommend this too everyone, but If you love platform and shoot em' up games. I can easily recommend this to you.  I'd this give game 8.5/10. Fantastic game, but you need some skill and knowledge on this game for you to really have a great time.",1
2016,"You want friends to play with and kill other people with guns? Nope. You want to be naked and kill someone with a rock? Nope. Build something while naked and with friends to kill people with rocks? Nope.Any survival game you see this days is about Zombies, A post-apocalyptic world, MP or All of them combined. The Long Dark is quite a different.You're going to be surviving by yourself. You will die horribly or just stupidly. You can survive for a week and just die embarassingly from freezing because of a blizzard. You can get eaten by wolves. or just starve to death in a matter of I don't know. A few hours? This is what a survival game is. It has a lot of potential. I can go on and on about what they should add. But i'm pretty sure most people have that covered. Love it! <3",1
2016,"This ♥♥♥♥er lives up to it's name of being the unforgiving son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ and it has the nerve to give you the option to rev up the difficulty to the point that hell seems like a kid's playground. But it's rich gameplay will make you want to play more and more even though you get your ♥♥♥ handed to you multiple times. If your an avid fan of Xcom, strategy games, turn-base gameplay, or even gambling, without caring about technical issues, then you've just found the game you'll play all year round. (If you also like dress up, then this also the game for you) An amazing game that is sadly plagued by bugs, glitches, and graphical issues. You have been warned.",1

2016,"A great and cheap game for when you have a spare moment or two. I was surprised by how addictive and fun this game was and the mechanics really suit the game as a whole. It also has achievements and trading cards which I also enjoy. This game is ideal if you hae some spare Steam funds, or if you need a game to wind down and relax.",1
2016,Garry's mod is a great game for screwing around and just doing pretty much anything,2
2016,"Brilliant game, the atmosphere is chilling and the art is wonderful. The first time I played this game, I was truly blown away by how gorgeous the enviroments were accompanied by an abundance of detail. The storyline is amazing, and the end left me speechless; a beautiful tale of love (as well as showing that love can be felt and received by anyone). If you have the time, pick up Gone Home, and indulge yourself entirely in this wonderful game.The Controls are smooth and everything works the way you want it to, the house is well-designed and there are endless crevices to be explored, a particular example is a TV room, when you first enter it, you'll get hit with a overwhelming sense of nostalgia, pillow forts and the blue-ish light that the TV casts across the room will leaving you smiling. The lighting in this game can create some gorgeous sights, and the lack thereof can send chills down your spine, granted the game isn't a horror, and I don't know whether it was intended or simply my own paranoia, but there are some cases where you may get a little scared, I'm not going to post any spoilers; but let's just say the house has plenty of backstory.Gameplay 9/10 (Controls are smooth, game works as you want it too; occasionaly getting stuck in doors)Level Design 9/10 (Beautiful area, the house gains more complexity as the game continues, but stays gorgeous)Soundtrack 8/10 (Throwback songs, not to mention the chillingly haunting tunes whenever a note from Sam is played)",2

2016,"A Great game, i highly recommend this to anyone who like the tactial style FPS games. This game will infuriate you, but for some reason you wont be able to stop playing it.If you like Team based games then this is the game for you, cooperation is needed to proceed with capturing trenches and repelling enemy attacks. With great graphics and a mostly awesome community you cannot go wrong with the money you spend on this game. ALthjough i do feel that gun unlocking/purchasing (with ingame points, not real cash) could be changed and possibly more information on the game itself could be supplied within the game such as tutorials and more explanation on how the unlocking process works.",1
2016,"This game continues with many of the features that have been entering the game in past few years. One of the major changes in this game is that you need to contract with sponsors to maintain your team. This being that your team (and all other teams) change each year, possibly even 5times in 5 years, this change increases the game play in my opinion. other than that the community updates and modifications upgrade the game greatly by adding a larger number of teams, variants and the like. of course there is always the occassional result which is unlikely to happen (such as a 55mountain climber winning major mountain stages).overall this game series improves each year.",1
2016,"Having been an avid player of this series since 2004, I had to buy this one. It has seen some big improvements on the 2013 iteration (especially the team name changes).The 3d game mode hasn't really seen much of a improvment (though that doesn't really bother me).Though, if you are not really a fan of cycling, this game will probably not intrest you.",1

2016,"Скажу в крации: игра крутаяДа она была крутая в 2008 году, эти былые времена, но сейчас 2015 (может быть и 2016) она не такая крутая в современное время. Мне было интересно в нее играть, мне показалось что она маленькая в своём сюжете (если играть по сюжету).Чтобы пройти игру по сюжету мне понадобилось 26 часов игры на нормальной сложности (я ее не менял)Главная проблема это оптимизация на Windows 7 её просто нет. Сначала было трудно вообще играть, постоянно вылетал(примерно 6 раз в  начале игры). Потом я установил один русификатор (потому что всё было на английском, но у меня с английским были некоторые проблемы) и кое что я там намудрил в файлах этого русификатора, после этого на удивление всё пошло прям как по маслу.Близилась концовка сюжета игры (я это понял потому что было много лута с патронами) последняя мисия была это запустить очиститель, я его запустил и пошел последний игровой ролик, потом после этого пошли титры.  Вопрос: Стоит ли брать эту игру?Я отвечаю: Да, стоит, думаю вы не пожалеете.P.s Извиняюсь если я пропустил запятые или слишком много их поставил.",1

2016,"*SPOILER ALERT m8's*Far Cry 3 is more of an experience than a game, one second you're partying on an island everything is smooth, next second you an your friends decide to go 'skydiving' on another 'remote' island, not so bad? But when you hit the ground you are ♥♥♥♥ed, this insane pirate called 'Vaas' ambushes and captures you and your friends who then plans to sell you into slavery. You wake up, tied up next to your older brother 'Grant' locked up in a bamboo cage, and to the right of you is Vaas, he then starts giving you a lecture about all this crazy ♥♥♥♥, your brother Grant (who served many years in the military), manages to get loose of the rope, unties you and calls a guard over to the cage, he then knocks out the guard, takes his key and opens the cage. You then have to slowly sneak past the guards in the compound until you reach the exit, unfortunately as you are escaping your brother is shot in the neck by Vaas, he then gives you the oppurtunity the run out of the compound while he and his guards are shooting at you, you run while bullets are flying past your head, you run through a rope bridge and luckily a helicopter containing a machine gunner starts firing at you, you sprint as fast as you can, but the bridge snaps, you fall in the water and knocked unconscious. Moments after a man named Dennis finds you and aids you, he then gives you a machete, information on Vaas, and a 1911 handgun. The game then starts from here.",1

2015,Really fun MOBA game to play. Quite a few characters to choose from as well. Didn't seem like a very fun game at first but Ieventually tried it out and i enjoyed it. Would really hope to see more new characters and possibly new gamemodes for this game!,1
2015,"Really fun game! I would definitely recommend this game to anyone! If it's on sale, just get it. You won't regret a single bit you spent on buying this game. Loads of content in this game. Many side quests, story missions are great, lots of interesting DLCs and there is also True Vault Hunter Mode! What are you waiting for? Just get the game now! I have enjoyed this game a lot and hopefully will be getting the DLCs soon. Hope all of you will enjoy this game as much as i did!",1
2010,"This is not not a standard review I would do because it will be a quick little review but I hope this will be helpfull.First of all I personally think that this game is solid and the world design is nothing short of beautiful and the story from what I played so far is pretty good aswel. But from what I read of the other reviews a lot of people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the 'pay to win' mechanic they have but to be fair I don't see it. They talk about grinding Astral diamonds, yes that is true but the items you get from the store paying with Astral diamonds you could get them by doing quests and the items you get like equipment they are for like level 60's so by that time you will have enough to buy the armour or you already have some epic unicorn armour. Another thing is Zen coins, a currency in game where you pay actual money to get or you exchange Astral diamonds, you might think ""HAWLY SHEIT that is pay to win right there"" just buy all the epics........ no its not like that because if you are willing to spend £24 for 3000 Zen coins that is jsut enough for 1 companion sure go ahead.Anyway lets some it up shall we, this game is amazing, awsome fighting mechanics, beautiful world design, a really good storyline interesting NPCs and outstanding voice acting. Overall you are missing out if you still didn't download Neverwinter and its free so what are you waiting.9.1/10",2

I assume that means that new players going into the version of AoM on Steam might not enjoy it as much as they would if they played the game in the past?Veldar: Well to make a judgement you have to put RTS into two piles:Veldar: Mirco and MarcoVeldar: Micro is the faster games C&C generals and Warcraft 3, matchs should last 5 - 15 minutes.Veldar: Where Macro, games like AoM, AoE 3 and SubCom are more about early economy and massing armies then pitting them against each other.AA | Cydran: I seeVeldar: I prefer Micro so a Macro game feels slower to me, I still very much enjoy it and I'll play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it but I know that it's not the best RTS by any means.",1

2015,"If you take enjoyment out of being a masochist and killing your friends in a game, then this is probably a game that you would enjoy... A LOT! Running as a parody to a lot of pop culture sci-fi and fantasy icons, Magicka will have you either laughing your ♥♥♥ off, crying tears of frustration, or throwing your laptop out the window because of the sheer difficulty of some of the levels and mobs (not to mention friends that blast you with that Summon Death, or Crash to Desktop spells...)Overall, the main campaign has 12 levels to get though and these can be tackled solo, or with up to three friends for carnage against the enemies, or your friends. Are you frustrated at a friend for sleeping with your girlfriend? Blow them up, and don't revive them! Simple.",1
1997,"This game is just... words can not possibly describe the emotional rollercoaster that this game places you on. From the moment you end up almost dead in the cop car at the start of the game, the game grants you many choices which determine the relationship that Lee has with other characters. It's all well and good to think that there is a right and wrong answer to everything, but there isn't. Each choice you make will have consequences that effect the way characters will respond to you later, so you must choose your allies well, lest you all become zombie chowder.The graphics are similar in style to the comic, which doesn't detract at all from the experience. The gruesome setail oozes off the screen and makes you feel for the situations that the characters are in. It's difficult to put into words how this occurs, as to mention where this happens, is to spoil the plot. Don't ever feel like you are safe, as in The Walking Dead, there is no such thing as safety - especially in numbers.",1
2015,"I wasn't so sure on this game when I first saw it, as I am not really a fan of FPS games. This game quickly proved that I had made a good investment, within even the first 15 minutes. The graphics are astounding, the music is amazing. Looking out over the cloud floating city of Columbia is simply awe inspiring. The story line is confusing and take a little to digest, but I feel that's a good thing. Plenty to explore, lots to see. I definitely recommend this game! 10/10!",1
2015,"Following on from playing The Walking Dead, I was keen to see what Telltale Games would do next. This game certainly doesn't disappoint. While The Wolf Among Us doesn't have flesh eating zombies, there is still a deep set story steeped in melodrama and intrigue.The Fables are a community of individuals that have escaped their fabled settings and have been forced to take up residency in the real ""mundane"" world. Magicked with Glamour that covers their non-human forms, the Fables try to scrape by in the unfamiliar world. In episode 1 we encounter The Big Bad Wolf, Snow White, Beauty, the Beast, one of the Three Little Pigs, and a winged monkey from The Wizard of Oz, to name a few. While the setting seems childish, it is anything but - with regular profanity throughout the dialogue, and gruesome battle sequences. (I even saw bare breasts in the trailer for episode 2)The choices made in the game effect later events, as was with The Walking Dead, and the first episode ends on a cliff hangar, which had me gasping (as was to be expected).Definitely looking forward to more!",1
2015,"Building upon the successful storytelling of ""The Walking Dead"", season 2 of the series picks up not too far on from where the previous game left off. It also does not hold any punches in the amount of trauma that you are forced to endure in order to stay alive within the post-apocalyptic world of ""The Walking Dead"".Interestingly, the controls have had a bit of an overhaul, in that the quick time events are a little more dynamic, and require more than just simply mashing the Q button, and then pressing E. There are dodges that need to be made, and if you fail to quickly scan your surroundings, you may end up being eaten.Some of the more pressing, and heart felt moments of the game shatter like a reflection in the mirror. Clementine can trust no-one. No-one. Trust me on this.",1

I just started the game and I've been thrown the torment difficulty instantly. The game itself though, is perfectly designed. The battles are fun and challenging, The dungeon exploration acts like your exploring a real life dungeon in 2D.FIRST of all, this game is NOT for you if you want the game to hold your hand through it.SECOND of all, This game is still early access, it is not complete, WHICH MEANS, major changes are approved.THIRD of all, this game has turn-based battles. Attacks can only be dodged by chance, so this means, without dodging an attack, or resisting an effect, you WILL take full damage.Note: You AND Monsters can resist effects and dodge attacks.SummaryThis game will give you the middle finger if you don't man up and think about what your doing. Do the wrong attack or force stress on your heroes. Your ♥♥♥♥ed.If you want to become a hero and fight the evil without hesitation.

2015,"Unearthed is a game about an explorer who goes to places where Ibn Battuta was. This game has an action-adventure genre with some puzzles. I think this game is pretty much like Uncharted. It has puzzles, action and adventure. This is a computer version of Uncharted. I recommend this game for people who love action and solving puzzles. I would give this game a rating of 8/10. Hopefully episode 2 will come out soon.",1

2015,"As a huge fan of Super Metroid and Hayao Miyazaki, this highly artistic 2D platformer with sublime gameplay is simply a masterpiece. Its hard to imagine what they could've done better; perhaps a few more different types of enemies? I'm so happy they invested in this single player adventure in this era and the price is a no brainer for all the work they put in this game. Vote with yuor wallet please, and let's show the world we want more games like this.",1

2015,"Had to buy the 'Review DLC' to write this.It was a good game.Still is.Only...You need to pay.For everything.Gage DLC = fiddy bucksChina Sword DLC = nin buksWank DLC = fiddy bucksChirstmas Songs You Can Hear In The Background On A Radio In One Heist = fiddy bucks2 much ♥♥♥♥ing dlc 4 my ♥♥♥♥.kill me.Alrght, for real though, there are way too many ♥♥♥♥ing DLCs. It's actually overwhelming and some of them don't even fit the Payday 2 theme. There's way more than $100 worth of DLC in this ♥♥♥♥ and it adds up to a butt load of updates and patches and whatnot. Do you know what updates and patches do? They add to the game. Do you know what adding to the game does? It increases file size. Look at it: this game is larger than TF2, GTA 4 and Garry's Mod. That's actually stupid as ♥♥♥♥.These guys started out as a four man team (5 if you technically include old Hox when he was in prison) who were bank robbers. Now they're a 14 man team of ♥♥♥♥ing terrorists. Seriously, they're legitamit terrorists now. Out of every heister they've added, only like 2 or 3 actually have a decent backstory or real reason for being on the team: Clover, Jiro and Hoxton. Literally no one else really deserves to be on the team. John Wick? Bodhi from Point Break? Jacket from Hotline Miami? Non of those make any real sense. They tried to explain it in the John Wick trailer for him  but after that is was basically a '♥♥♥♥ it' from Overkill and they just didn't try for promotional characters. Jacket looks like he's in his 20's in game but if this game takes place in the same universe as Hotline Miami he'd be in his late 40's. None of it makes any sense.The base game is amazing and if they stopped releasing payed DLC's at about the second Gage Weapon Pack (they should just release all Gage Whatever Packs as one DLC at lease) and just had the rest be free from then on, no one would've ♥♥♥♥♥ed and I would probably be able to recommend this game. What really bugs me is how they make a DLC for every individual thing they add. For example The Diamond Heist was added at about the same time Clover was added. The Diamond Heist was a one part map that was kind of suppose to be Shadow Raid 2 but was in the end short and easy as ♥♥♥♥. It costs $7. Clover was linked to The Diamond Heist mostly story wise if you paid attention and her individual pack cost like $5-7 at the time. Why the ♥♥♥♥ would you not release the two together in the same DLC? Buying both individually as two separate DLC's costs just over or around %50 of the actual game's cost. This goes for, as previously mentioned, the Gage Weapon Packs (or just all the weapon packs in general), The Dentists Heists (Alesso, Golden Grin and Big Bank should be together. The Diamond can get a pass here if they combined it with the Clover pack but they could just have all The Dentist jobs together as a whole AND include Clover in them and whoever else was added in the Dentist's jobs (Sokol)) and have all the collaboration heists and characters just be free updates if you want (but seriously, I have to pay $7 for a GOAT SIMULATOR HEIST). And I'm guessing if you've made it this far you want me to touch on the microtransactions? Well They're microtransactions in a $20 game that has more than $100 worth of DLC. Sure Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a $15 game with microtransactions but at least they have free updates, not DLC's and the microtransactions in the game when you really think about it kind of bring the community together and everyone, while they kind of still dislike them don't feel like they have to buy them for some stat boost.The game at it's core is great, though. It has amazing music, sounds and overall premise but I just can't recommend the game even with a %50 sale on it. Wait till it has %75 sale on itself and all the DLC before buying it, trust me.",1
2015,Got every achievement in 22 minutes.,1
2015,I've played a lot of games in my years. Half-Life. Halo. Call of Dooty. GTA. Hotline Miami. TF2. Hundreds of games. This game is in my top 5.PROS-EverythingCONS-No sequal yet :(,1
2013,MORE ADDICTING THAN CRACK.okay i bought this game cause why not i had some left over cash when i did i found out i no longer wanted to sleep anymore i played this the night i bought it up till 4 am and now im awake again im playing again.its addicting like you wouldnt believe its got a great battle system and above all is very well made game.would only recomend to people who dont actually sleep because once ya start ya cant stopAWESOME GAME I GIVE IT A 8/8 M8 DIS GAM 2 GR8,1
2013,"So i have seen from a lot of people they get bored very quickly. thing is. amongst the drama with multiplayer. amongst the hardware troubles with some. it is a game that you have to know wether it is for you or not.this isn't a action game. but there is plenty of adrenaline if you look for it.this isn't a fetch quest game (like grab that get this get better things). but you have a choice to look for everything, and at the same time look for one thing only.this isn't a spaceship game (ones like star citizen or elite dangerous etc.). but you can upgrade to cooler looking or more usefull ships and partake in battles against massive legions.this however is a exploration game. not just in the game. but for yourself. you FIND what you like about this game. and the stick to it. there is not limitations. it gives you the freedom to do anything but gives you the option of a goal.reach the center. you can completly ignore it and just decide to explore the universe and just gawk at the beautyultimately this is a game where you NEED to experience it. but do know that as i've said. its not for everyone. but you can always refund it. if you love it then my wishes for safe flight fellow traveler.Personal note: i don't have a beast of a machine but on occassion i do get a big lag spike. which is fine because all i have to do to fix it is save and reload the game. and if thats all the problems i'll encounter to play this beautiful game then i have no issues.8/10 still needs work technical side but a fantastic game overall.",1
2015,I made two bog rolls become a paper towel roll.10/10 best game eu/au/nu/wewewbut in all seriousness this is a amazing game. great mechanics that are simple to use but difficult to master (which i love btw)a little bug which even though may be a bug i dont want them to fix is that if the parts for a vehicle are lower then the jack. it can stick into the ground. which actually helped me keep my things in place so they wouldn't fly/drive off.multiplayer works great through the P2P system AND TO GET THAT RIGHT IS A ♥♥♥♥ING AWARD IN ITSELF.what id like as a aditional part is a keybind system that when your in a seat you can use certain binds to active things like attached switches. i say this because i made a car that has fold out thruster/boosters but i was only able to use them by either flipping a switch then getting in the car or by making the car go forward connecting it to the controllerall in all a great well made game that even on the point of realease i had no troubles with this game.recommend to anyone who loves rudigoldberg machines or besige,1
2015,Okay so this game has got a good tutorial system and for a Alpha its all right. but this game 90% of the time is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. unless you play this game 24/7 with the patience of a monk you will hate it. like i do. would no reccomend to any casual gamers. maybe ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. cause thats what this game plays to,1

2015,"Sem duvidas um otimo jogo de sobrevivenica mas muito enjoativo depois de no maximo 50 horas, sem duvidas esse jogo foi um dos mais vendidos da steam esse ano.Oque acho bom desse jogo é que ele elsta sendo completamente refeito, com novos graficos. A nova versão esta em testes, mas já possivel jogala. Como disse, ela ainda esta em testes, então exite alguns bugs. Como o de toda vez que fecho o jogo na nova versão, minha placa de rede para de funcionar, então tenho que reiniciar o pc.",1
2015,A jogabalidade é boa e é muito divertido para jogar com os amigos.,1
2015,"O jogo está muito divertido, dinâmico e frenético, a movimentação (Thrust jump, slide, wall run) e os especialistas acrescentaram muito ao multiplayer. No começo estava lagado, mas agora é muito dificil achar uma sala com lag. O zombies não tem nem o que falar, Treyarch mandou muito bem com os mapas que vieram com o jogo e continua melhorando nos que vem por dlc.",1
2015,Is there better?,2
2015,"Even if the Grand Theft Auto series has always been good, this was one of the best games in the series. In many people's opinion it was better than GTA IV. Although it wasn't perfect, the sheer size of San Andreas was something that could not be denied. It had country sides and even the city of Los Santos. This was R* (Rockstar's) best game until GTA V. Even thought GTA: SA is old I still enjoy playing it and it's still  great game. The story is great and the open-world is fun too. I highly recommend it.(it's better than minecraft)",2
2015,"Basic GameplayYou play as either a Counter-Terrorist or a Terrorist, both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice.You can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money, Although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you.On the Terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm.. important boxes?.Anyway, once plant wait You patiently for it to explode.As a Counter-terrorist you must eliminate all the Terrorist forces OR defuse the bomb, thus Protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction.Being a honourable opponent, Terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the Ct's the chance to Slaughter the remaining T's, and defuse the bomb.I'll list some positive/negative attributes of this game here.Positive attributes :- Matchmaking - Teaches children the harsh reality of gambling (although some never seem to learn even after $500 later)- Ranks  - Cool looking skins- Fast growing population of players  - Fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often- Chickens- High replay value- Deathmatch game type (I could go into more detail on negative parts of it, but that would make this review too long and boring)Negative attributes :Although I Do love the single player campaign, it could use some work. I REALLY wish it were longer.. And that final Boss fight is pretty lame. It only lasts around 27 seconds, and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you, and how his ""7 year old could beat you, blindfolded.""- The game mode ""Infernal"" played on the map ""de_inferno""Some people like this game mode however I personally dislike it, For those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it I'll explain for you.It seems like any normal de_ map However, The real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego, Normally it's hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map, and has the ability to shift/move around to different locations, Or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time.- Demolition, Also known as ""jokemode"" Added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every April fool's day, However some hacker probably that ""4_chan"" guy, permanently unlocked it. (Volvo have been working on a fix ever since)Demolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents. Also no block is Enabled And Whoa?, So is team killing!The volka StrategyYou could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins, OR you could play the game correctly like me. Here is my strategy :-  Don't buy skins to start with, Seriously it's a waste of money.-  Play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get.- Wait for a steam sale and Invest in as many copies of csgo you can.- Work your way up to about 5 copies or so But make sure you don't get too many otherwise you won't have enough time to harvest all your csgo account drops (having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns) [Note- it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops].- Keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops.- Once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have. Remember to Never gamble with opening cases. I've made about $100 with this method. I think it's about time to quit my day job.In a whole, I do love this game And would recommend to anyone, Good half, Good half.",1
2015,"Farcry 3 Is a rpg first-person shooter, with a hint of  ""Cassowary Attack Simulator""You play as Jason Brody, And your objective ?To find your friends captured by the evil cassowary king ""Hoyt Volker"" (no relation to me)Basically you go around killing stuff and then skinning animals to make a better handbag, weapons purseand ammo sack.Since Hoyt Volker is the cassowary king he possess the power to control cassowaries. He uses them to attack you while you loot the enemies you just killed.. Goodluck and remember to play with your sound on, otherwise you will never know how close those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off cassowaries are to flay you while you are feeling up some dead guy for 4 $ and a spent lighter.",1
2015,"Possibly one of the most simply designed and beautiful games I've ever played, flawlessly combining simple control and gameplay with a rich and enrapturing story and soft or bold colour palette, seamlessly set to fit the respective tone. Amazing game, straight A's, 10/10.",2
2015,"""If Call of Duty and Minecraft had a baby-""Abort.",2
2015,"This game is absolutely amazing. It incorporates such simple dynamics and just makes them fresh and fun as all hell. It's literally just a giant, pink, glowing, alien shooting, rage fest. And a damn good one too. Gameplay: One moment you will be strolling around looking for upgrades dropped by that weird VTOL type Police thing, and the next you will be running as fast as you ♥♥♥♥ing can right back where you came from shooting the ♥♥♥♥ out of hordes and hordes and aliens with your upgraded plasma gun. So yeah, gameplay wise, this game is the ♥♥♥♥. The only complaint I have is that on Countryside, things get way too crammed and it kinda ruins that run and gun experience, but every other map is pretty damn solid.Sound: The sound design is pretty good. The creepy, glitchy, alien music sets the intense yet stylish mood right from the get-go. The aliens make these weird sounds all unique to each type, which makes it all the more awesome yet terrifying when you hear certain ones coming your way.Weapons: The weapons are awesome. Hands down great. They each have their own unique style of gameplay and make for a unique experience each time. The pistol seems to be the only weapon which just isn't worth investing your hard earned cash in, but oh well. Each weapon can be upgraded 3 times, and they all have different prices based on I suppose the develepors view of their awesomeness and worth (which means the rocket launcher is obviously gonna be the most expensive, even though I prefer the plasma gun myself). I wish they would add some more weapons, and maybe change their designs which are pretty bland at the moment, but otherwise they are top notch.Maps: Before I did complain about one map, Countryside which just really seems to be too squished compared to the other maps I've played so far, but that's about all of the negatives for the maps. They are relatively well spaced out, and while they are challenging enough to manuever around, they are also fair and give you chances to escape the alien horde at almost every turn, albeit only just alive that is. Other: With developers that constantly change and add things to the game, this game will always feel new and fresh every time you come back to play it. I haven't really played much multiplayer at the moment, so I can't really give my view on that, but one thing I feel the developers absolutely NEED to add is some customization. The guy you control is really really bland, and it almost ruins the quirky side of the atmosphere. I'd just love to see some customization of my character and give him some of my own little traits. Other than that, that is all I can really think of.Summary:Positives:-Great pace-Intense gameplay-Quirky style while also maintaining atmosphere-Creepy yet silly sound design-Nice array of weapons-Constant updatesNegatives:-Lack of character customisation (lol not even a negative tbh)-Some map designs are a bit off (*cough* countryside)Overall, I give it a 9.5/10. Basically just a quick game to play every now and then and have a blast while doing so. :)",1
2015,"This game is the perfect sequal to Portal. The gameplay is simmilar enough so that peple who have not played the first installment, can just enjoy the story for what it is.",1
2015,"I love this game. The story lines that each character has is in depth and well thought out. The combat can be a bit spammy at first, but it works once you get to the higher levels.",1
2015,"So normally I don't really write reviews, but this is one of those times where I feel like I should.RWBY: Grimm Eclipse is a pretty freaking amazing game for being in Early Access. I have followed this game since its inception and it has not let me down yet. GE (Grimm Eclipse) is a hack and slash game which can be played with upto four people. The basis of GE, RWBY, is an animated show released by RoosterTeeth, and this game shows how amazing that company can be.The story is still pretty bare bones, but is constantly being added to as the updates roll out. However, the story in GE is seperate from RWBY, from Volume 2 of the show on. This is great as it allows the devs to have fun with the IP they got.The gameplay, where do i begin, is freaking awesome. Think Metal Gear Rising: Revengance with 4 highschool girls in a world where the normal rules of physics are thrown out of the window. Each character has their own play style, and moves to complement said style. Personally I play as Weiss Schnee. She is more of the mage character, as she is more support and area based with her moves than the rest of her team. While i do mainly play as Weiss, i have unlocked all the special skills for every character. While it can take some time if you do it on your own, playing with others, whether its friends or random people, is much more enjoyable and will net you more kills.Graphically it looks breath taking. This game is built in unity, so be prepared for bright colours and amazing models. There are a few different graphical settings: Potato, for if you dont have the best PC/Laptop, Normal, and Ultra, which is what i run. There is no V-Sync, however with the right settings it will run at a buttery smooth 60FPS.All in all this game is really enjoyable and if you have the money, give it a go, you will not regret it!I rate this game a 9.5/10, but keep in mind this is still an early access game.",1
2015,its ok if u get used to it so give it a go,2

The graphics are pretty and nice to look at.The only issiue I found was the learning cure, this is the firs Civ game I played so it took me some time to learn all the mechanics.

2015,"Rust is a survival game in which you must gather resources and craft items in order to survive. But sadly there is an element of human interaction which can be both friendly or hostile. You will soon find that everyone is HOSTILE. I do not know why but other players rarely if ever show reciprocity. It is quite demeaning to spend 2 hours building a base and crafting for it to just get destroyed by rage-kids with rocket launchers. This game has a nice concept, despite its good intentions, other players are a large error factor which ruins a good game.  I am displeased at best by this game, it runs terribly on a GTX980 with a lot of frame dips. After doing some research I found that it is poorly optimised for most newer systems. So if you have a 980, 970, 780, 770 you will not be able to run this game as smoothly as you should.   I am very disappointed by this game, it is a good game but the players are the most unlikeable ♥♥♥ holes you will ever encounter. Most players kill other players just because they are unable to defend themselves. I can only imagine those trigger happy players and anti-social sociopath with little empathy and respect for others work and effort. I do not blame the developer for the players, but I blame him (the developer) for the poor optimization.   To summarise; This game runs poorly on $1895 PC's The players are malevolent vindictive bullies with no respect for others Its overpriced and over rated. It makes my blood boil with rage.  DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WISH TO GET ANNOYED BY ARROGANT SOCIO PATHS. Update The performance issues have been resolved, but the comunty is still ♥♥♥♥♥ed!",1

2015,"So, you wish to ask if this is a good game, well let me ask you something first!Are you a fan of hardcore military simulators where one shot is the difference between life and waiting 10 seconds to respawn? Are you a communist, capitalist or just a casual nazi?Or do you just want to see the world burn?If you answered yes to any of those, this game is for you.There are plenty of server worldwide and the game is active and alive, you will always find a well populated server with reasonable ping. The communty is mostly comprised of very experienced players, but don't worry, there are no little screamers it's mostlymature adults who will help you if you have any questions.The game sounds, feels and looks great.I literaly get scared when a bullet whisels over my head, knowing every shot can kill adds to the experience.In terms of graphics the game looks super good, it runs well on all systems, even my dads laptop can play it on medium and still reach the 62FPS cap. And yes the FPS is capped at 62. The sounds are realistic as I have fired the K98 and Mosim in real-life and I can tell you the game does a good job of replicating their noise.The controls are easy to get used to and are not overly complicated.It's a game that I can recommend to anyone, no matter how good or bad they are at FPS games.It is not a 'easy' game, but it is not hard to get into, after about 10 hours you should know the role of each class and most of the camping spots on more popular maps.It's also a good game to give your grandpa to remind him of his experiences in World War 2.

2015,"As it stands this game has a long way to go.Improvements that should be made:1.	Un-optimised game2.	slow frame rate 3.	buggy ragdolls4.	Boring grindy leveling and dinosaur capture system5.	Challenging in the wrong ways6.	Combat is to easy and uses no real unique mechanics7.	Levelling is used for too much (in terms of craftables)8.	Levelling web like Robo-craft or Kerbal SP would be better9.	Resources are too difficult to obtain10.	Building takes too much in terms of resources (makes the game more grindy than it should be)11.	Loot is stupid meat rots to fast and you should get more for the kill: bones, teeth, skulls, and the stomach contents of the animal (berry’s, bones, meat, plant fibre) 12.	If levelling system is kept greater reward for kills in terms of XP is need (currently collecting berries is the most effective form of levelling)13.	Hunting should include more depth (tracking sent trails ECT should be added)14.	Riding is a pain: no backwards movement15.	Different types of meat should be included for taming dinosaurs16.	Less dinosaurs more mammals small rodents and herbivores17.	More server slots needed18.   Oil and other late game ingredients are to hard to getbut to be honest it is just perfect the way it is :)",1

A thumping industrial heavy metal soundtrack that demands that you headbang as you slaughter demons in the hundreds. A hellish version of Mars that is bright where required, dark and forboding when needed, and never dull and lifeless in its tone.And the everpresent feeling that, no matter how bad the odds look, no matter what the game throws at you, you will overcome. You will survive. You will win.Rip and tear, son. This is the start of a new age where DooM has claimed its rightful place on the throne of shooters.(Also, the MP is aight/10. But who cares?)",1

2015,"Alan Wake's American Nightmare builds on the plot on that of Alan Wake.The story involves Alan Wake's usual nightmares but this time, his 'evil-twin' a.k.a. Mr. Scratch is terrorising nearby towns and turning them into darkness, setting a trap that turns back the time over and over again. Alan Wake travels from place to place: a barren wasteland, to an observatory, and a drive-in theatre, in an attempt to restore light and stop the darkness so he can confront Mr. Scratch and defeat him.Overall the game is an expansion on that of its predecessor, adding on a variety of weapons that are unlockable by collecting manuscripts, which encourages exploration of the entire map. Unfortunately, the experience is cut short due to the lack of missions available in this expansion.Nonetheless, a decent game and one I would truly recommend if one has completed its predecessor.P.S. Check out my other review for details on Alan Wake.",2
2015,"Dark Souls is an action role-playing game set in an open environment. The game evolves around the player character who escapes from an asylum and soon learns the prophecy of being selected as the chosen undead, who must succeed in undoing the undead curse.The game's plot is minimalistic, and varies based upon how much the player explores. There is little guidance and lack of direction given. The player must come to his/her intuition as to which path one must take, which can ultimately lead to a dead end, desired destination or even branching paths.This game is not just an ordinary casual RPG. It is a survival RPG for hardcore players who seek a challenge, as dying is frequent and mini-bosses are abundant. To add to that, monsters deal a lot of damage and players must learn to time their blocks and attacks rather than hack n' slashing. Save points are limited and scattered far from one another. The game evolves around the concept of using deaths to teach players to learn from their mistakes, as well as how to react in almost relentlessly hostile environments. From experience, there has not been many RPGs that has challenged me the way Dark Souls has. I must reiterate: this game is EXTREMELY difficult.The button mapping and camera controls for keyboard is messy. If one were to consider buying this game, it is a PREREQUISITE to have a gamepad/controller or you will be in for a hard time. The graphics is not the best, but it is made up by the deep gameplay and non-stop action.Overall, Dark Souls is a quality RPG game that challenges players to a new level. It is matched with sheer happiness and relief upon progress and completion. If adventure is to surprise and mystify you and invite you to uncover the secrets of a forgotten world, then Dark Souls is a great game for you. If entertainment is fun without failure and progress without pain, you'll have to find another game.",2
2015,"Serious Sam 3: BFE (BIG ♥♥♥♥ing EDITION) is a first-person action shooter, which takes place during the Earth’s final struggle against Mental’s invading legions of beasts and mercenaries. Set against the collapsing temples of an ancient civilization and the crumbling cities of 22nd century Egypt, the game features a huge amount of over the top gunplay, funny characters, weird enemies and fantastic levels.The CO-OP is fantastic, which allows up to 16 players blowing ♥♥♥♥ up.A recommendation for anyone that loves shooting up mayhem and having a good laugh with buddies.#Note: The game has an option to run in third person view, which may provide a suitably enjoyable gaming experience for those who prefer TPS or have motion sickness in FP view.",2
2015,"Payday 2 is a four-player cooperative first person shooter which is a sequel to Payday: The Heist. This game involves up to a team of 4 players performing bank heists and robberies. Gameplay has been HEAVILY (and I mean HEAVILY!) improved and expanded since its predecessor. Instead of running-and-gunning, more emphasis is put on the cooperation of players. Using unique abilities such as stealthing, as opposed to a noisy approach rewards players with better paydays, making this game suitably enjoyable for both the casual and hardcore gamers! :)The game features character skill levelling, to be added into customisation skill trees of choice: Mastermind, Enforcer, Technician, or Ghost; all of each has its role and has individual unique traits and abilities that can be mixed-matched per player's preference. Not one skill tree can be said to be better than the other, and this is massively important in co-op. It focusses on having a team of players who specialise in separate skill trees, to successfully complete missions.Unlockable weapons (gun-mods!) and masks (patterns and materials!) makes the game rewarding and even more addictive and exciting.Huge NOTE to point out:Overkill Software are constantly balancing out skill trees, adding new weapons and masks, as well as missions as time goes by to keep players engaged in the game. The developers have done an amazing job in making the game much MUCH better than its predecessor. There is not one feature I can think of that has not superceded those of Payday: The Heist. The fact that Overkill software is such an amazing company makes buying the game and supporting the developers worthwhile.Hopefully more updates to come! Gimme moar weapons, masks and missions!!!",2
2015,"It is my pleasure and absolute honour to review Project CARS.This game is by far one of the best and most enjoyable simulator car games I've played.I'm an avid fan of all types of racing games, from arcade to simulator and a cross of both.If you are a simulator freak, then this game is for you.Firstly, the selection of cars that are available on this game will be abundant enough to keep you playing for hundred of hours. From Road cars to Touring and GT cars, to Formula A/B/C, vintage racing models (and even GO-KARTS!); players will be busy running through all the different competitions and racetracks in career mode.The track selection is quite ideal; they have long racing tracks for fast cars, small tracks with lots of turns for the nippy lower CC cars, even smaller tracks for go-karts, and also highways (YES HIGHWAYS) for road cars.There is however, no rally/drift cars and tracks available (I heard they are releasing this in Project CARS 2 - something to look forward to).The graphics is appealing, the cars and tracks are well designed to look like their real life counterparts. The physics is astonishing. When it is raining you can hear the raindrops pouring/dripping onto your windscreen and even on the roof; then comes the sound of your windscreen wipers as it brushes the water through, which to me is so immersive that I felt a sudden rush of cool air as I was driving (sounds crazy right?!)You can change the paintjob/decals of your cars in the garage which I think is pretty cool. Career mode is great. You can alter the length of races so for those who don't want to grind it out, you can specify the amount of laps per race they are willing to race. Or why not challenge yourself if you are a freak and do the 24 hour Le Mans race?! =) The choice is yours. As you win races in career mode, your newsfeed/Fan chat lights up with Twitter messages showing praises/criticism (depending on your performances) from all around the world. You will progress and secure better contracts for better teams OR promoted to a better Tier of racing.Last but not least, the car setups are so realistic that you could spend hours just practicing and finding the ideal setup for your car on each track. As for driving itself, you can turn off all aids and immerse in the full manual experience with manual clutch and shifters and even manual start your engine when it stalls (oh my god right). Or if you're not so hardcore, you can always use paddle shifters/manual sequential (and of course Automatic, but who drives on Auto!)A small minority of people have said that the online experience can be quite buggy, personally I have found the online system to have no bugs/glitches/lag so far. I've even managed to play with my cousin for a few hours on 450 ping with no issues. That being said, the single player experience is enough to keep most players engaged and appealed.I could go on forever but I'll end it here. Project CARS is an amazing simulator experience. The only negative I would point out is the AI. When you are driving certain tracks and heading around corners, they just seem to stick to one racing line and if you happen to cross their line, they will bump and clean you up, causing you to spin/crash etc.I'm giving it at least a 9/10, and looking forwards to writing my review for Project CARS 2 when it comes out; if they input in rally and drift cars/tracks. Recommend to play this game on a good set of wheel and pedals, with decent gear shifters.",2
2015,"NBA 2K16 is the best basketball game that has been produced to date under the 2K series.MyTeam is incredibly fun and easy to build a Dynasty, you can build a sick roster within 6 hours of gameplay; and there are plenty of scenarios and challenges to complete to unlock historic, throwback and other amazing cards.With Spike Lee's creativity added to MyPlayer, the whole mode has become so in-depth and immersive that you almost feel like you are beginning and going through an entire career of basketball yourself. There's also a cool MyPark mode now that allows you to challenge other people online in.New to this year is the 2KTV, which has lots of interviews and content with current and former basketball stars; that you can just view at your leisure and earn easy VC points. During these videos, there are also trivias and other options available to keep you further engaged.Graphics and gameplay are heavily improved, although pick and roll is still imbalanced!Not to mention that 2K are constantly bringing in new skins, and shoes when connected to Steam updates.Overall 5/5 and definitely would recommend this to basketball lovers.2K Sports has taken sports gaming to a whole new level and are showing to EA Sports how much fun playing MyTeam can be without having the need to spend any cash (compared to the boring and endless grind of FIFA Ultimate Team).",2
2015,"Football Manager 2016 is by far the best Football Manager series that has been made under the Sports Interactive series thus far.Online modes and realism of the match engine has been hugely improved, and a whole lot of frustrating bugs and exploits have been addressed and fixed - much to football lovers satisfaction.The input of Prozone for match statistics brings huge depth into game analysis.There is also a cool fantasy drafting/transfer as well as challenge modes added to this year's game.Overall 5/5 and will keep any football crazy fan engaged for hundreds of hours.",2

After I finally managed to glitch into it, I underestimated it's ability to travel at light speed, which in turn caused me to crash into a wall.

2015,"Best purchase I've made in a long time, was amazed at this game, it satisfied all my zombie needs from the exploring to the building of the community. Rarely I'm impressed with a game but this was amazing, I recommend this game to everyone",2
2015,"Addictive, fun and very relaxing to play ",2
2015,"As an avid city builder fan, and also a fan of previous tropico games, Tropico 5 does not dissapoint me and has made some changes that makes the series so much better. I would have to say the trading system and the modernizing of the housing has been my most favourite changes of all.",2
2015,"Most addicting tower defence. Lots to do and plenty of replayability, love it.",2
2015,"If you are a fan of tycoon games, this is a must!Pros: - Console development- Great development team who updates the game regularly- Good sense of replayability - Ability to branch out into many different aspects of the video game industry- The many rooms such as marketing, customer support, quality assurance, research, motion capturing, + more, immerces you into feeling like you're running an actual games company- It is more friendly and easy to beautify your company- the game is easy to pick up and well worth the money - You can find yourself playing way more than intended- You can train employees in the skills that matter to their job- You can make MMOs and addons- You can patch your game after release as well as develop updatesIt's safe to say there are many positives, it is well worth a purchase and the development team deserve a thumbs up, there are many more aspects of the game I have not listed. It seems that the little features that you notice go a long way. Final review: The game is worth the money, and cannot be compared to game dev tycoon as Mad Games Tycoon is something unique in itself that allows you to branch into many different aspects of the gaming industry. Conclusion - WORTH BUYING",2

2015,"This Review Was Made During Early Access. It May Become A Useless Review As The Game Progresses But This Is How It Is Right Now. currently There Are Only Three Quests Which Are.Get LootGo To Planet And Kill Aliens And Find Dead PeopleAnd Of Course, Flying Across The Universe And Killing People To Find Some Guy A Sandwhich.The Game Is However Alot Of Fun And Shows Alot Of Potential But As Of Yet Needs Alot Of Work Done To Keeping Players Intertained And Having Larger Questlines. The Chat System Works Well With The Ocasional Crash Of The Game Which Is Expected As It Is In Early Access. In The Future Of The Game I Think Having Player Vs Player Open World With Clans/Guilds Could Be A Possibilty. Sadly The Early Access Game Is Very Poorly Optimized With Some Of The Top Computers Getting Around 25 FPS On Lowest Graphics Which Is A Shame. Overall This Game Is Worth Its Price Tag So If You Are Into Open World Space Games With A Touch Of Combat And A Lot Of Exploration This Is The Game For You!",1
2015,"Awesome Game, Great Graphics Only Thing They Need To Make It Less Demanding On Your PC",1
2015,Grand Theft Auto Had A Hefty Price Tag.

2015,"At its core Global Offensive/Counter Strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken Microsoft mouses.The emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around. It creates an atmosphere that games like Battlefield and Call of Duty hasn't been able to reproduce. On the outside Counter Strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned FPS gamer.The game is simply tactful; it’s brilliant when you’re alive and even when you’re dead the game is still fun to watch other players.Global offensive is a competitive game and a casual one, although for casual gamers it's probably better to find community servers over Valve servers. There's a huge market place now for the items in CS:GO and not only that, there's third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these in-game items have createdYou will also find on Twitch CS:GO is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions, if you need any convincing watch a stream, watch a competitive match and see for yourself.This game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library. Overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself.",1
2015,"This game was probably one of those decently challenging games with an easy to understand storyline even though the texts come at you in large quanties it delievers a lot about the storyline, the gameplay itself is fantastic even though i finished it in about 4 hours the puzzles in this game were challenging but not too overly hard where you get to the point of bashing your computer in but it has a nice decent gradual difficulty climb and i like how you could achieve the same thing but in different ways,",2
2015,"I have found game to be very... great at what it does, (I hope thats making you sit down shutup and concentrate) because it did that to me for an hour just sitting their reconfiguring all my trains just thinking that 'I like Trains' all that I wish for is to be able to have a sydney map then this game would be perfect. Overall it's a great game even though its an early access game and I plan on playing it for many hours to come, good job developer all that I require is a map maker",2

2015,"The plot is good, the gameplay is good, the graphics are bad.Extreme caution though before you buy - the game can be extremely glitchy and crashy depending on environment, but many people have problems with it. If you'll be able to fix it from crashing, you won't be able to fix the giltches. The glitches that prevent you from simply enjoying the game, and also including the glitches that stop you from proceeding with the game.Also, it auto-saves to only 1 save. So you cannot go back or make your own saves - unless you manually quit out of the game and make backups of the freaking thing.So the game's context is good, but bloody annoying technically.",1
2015,"Amazing Game, though it says it doesnt support english, its not true, the game has full english XD",1
2015,"This game has A lot of potential, but i found so many bugs in this game, and with WB not releasing a patch anytime soon, i don't see myself being able to play the game, because i encountered a problem where i couldn't keep goin with the game. There is also no-where that i can report this because WB's forums are not monitored as they are not making a patch,This game is NOT recommended, at least until they make a patch",1
2015,"Well for $4.99 its a laugh, reminds me of the Omen Movies....there is something kinda fun roaming around and killing people as a 6 year old kid....lolGraphics are great for an Indie game, storyline short but intense, kinda game you play on a widescreen monitor in the dark.",1

2015,"Well I have been waiting a very long time since the first Wolfenstein, and its so been worth the huge gap.This game is the bomb, from a gritty narative storyline, to superb graphics and fantastic gameply.This has got to be one of the gaming highlights of the year for any FPS gamer...seriously.",1
2015,"Well time to relive my youth with advanced gameplay and graphics.I dont care what anyone says, The campaign is old school doom in a modern format.....and playing it gives me that raw power and exhilaration kinda feel that a FPS should give you. So far I have had no glitches, no tearing and no issues with the gameplay and that spells to me that ID and Bethesda have released a solid product. This is something that most new releases cant do.The finished product is polished, fast paced and fun....and be warned if you stand still for more than 2 seconds on the nightmare setting, you WILL die.On saying that I do have a coupel of small negatives, the Music gets very repetitive very fast and the fact that they have released a DLC at such a ridiculous price, just to make extra money does not sit well for me.The multiplayer also lacks matchmaking balance, as a Lvl 1 player I was matched against a team with a lvl30, a lvl26 and 4 level 19 players. Our team had 3 lvl1, a level 9, a level 11 and a level 21 player. Hardly seems fair in the scheme of things.The MP also will get very repetitive very fast but the range of gametypes is nice.I will add to this once I have also had some experience with snapmap, but its certainly looks like a great part of an exceptional game already.",1
2015,Eh...Game = Good,2
2015,muito da hora,1

2015,This is a game that you play in you spare time and when you have got alot of it. I know its a visual novel and what not but still the extansive dialog that takes hours to get through is just a tad exessive. ONLY play this game if you want an easy detective game and an anoying ending. Only posotives for the game are its characters and some of the puzzels.,1

2015,"Excellent turn-based strategy game, one of the best of our time. It combines the traditional strategy game approach of conquering one's allies with other more intellectual ways to do so such as cultural, diplomatic, science. Multiplayer as well as expansion packs such as gods & kings and brave new world, add new depth to the game and further inhance the experience of the game.

2015,"Guns of Icarus is very tactical and teamwork based. It's very difficult to win without it.Servers are usually okay, only sometimes laggy if your connection isn't too great. I would recommend checking server locations before giving this a go in case it is unplayeably laggy.Matchmaking takes quite a long time. Good practice with patience. When you get into a game it is worth it.Team balancing can sometimes be terrible with a very skilled team on one side and near newbies on the other.Best played with friends because I think you could imagine what chaos ensues if the people aboard a flying dinghy had no coordination.I would like to see grapples or zipwires in the game so we can board other people's ships and start whacking their balloon out of the sky.",1

Communication is not entirely necessary but it definitely improves your teamwork, survivability and end result. When the core is getting attacked and you can't handle it, call a friend.The reload mechanics are really powerful. When one weapon runs out of ammo, just swap to the other one. When you swap back to the first weapon you will find that it has already been reloaded without having to wait for the reload animation. I found this very handy in sustaining damage output on the large bugs. If you have explosive rounds, you can use those to push the NPC's and your teammates around. I have mostly been on the receiving end of this...",1
2015,"Transformice is a platformer in which you join a lobby and cycle through game modes, each presenting a new puzzle. There were A LOT of players in each lobby I joined. In my experience, the main goal is to climb over each other to get to the door. Communication is handy in this game but it's difficult to explain what to do in the text chat... and players rarely listen anyway. Overall, it's a fun way to kill time if you like platformers and also like seeing a lot of players do random stuff to each other while trying to solve a problem together. Always had a good laugh from this game 7/10. The community 2/10.",1
2015,"Lie and cheat your way to victory.Firstly, I would like to clear up some of the misconceptions about the game at launch. Many of the reviews were negative because (and I totally agree) it was REALLY buggy and there were very few servers available. A few days after the release of HIT the developers came up with a patch which fixed many gameplay issues I experienced when I first played it. Kudos to the devs for patching some menu and in game lag issues. The lack of servers will be less of an issue as more players join. You cannot expect a free to play game which was just released to have dedicated servers.As it is, the game has an attractive retro aesthetic. There are 4 classes of characters to choose from when you are in the lobby - each character with his/her own active and passive abilities. One rogue agent is selected by the game at random at the beginning of each round and each player is shown whether they are a good agent (operative) or the bad agent (rogue). The rogue is able to convert one operative into a rogue and together they must stop the operatives from completing the three missions.The lever mission is cleverly implemented. It promotes teamwork, communication between players and reverse psychology.As of now, there is only one map with the objectives spawning at random locations throughout the house.This game is best played with at least 2 other friends. There is no in game communication (yet?) so a third party voice chat client is recommended. Server making and joining is simple but I would like to see password protection on lobbies later on as the game gains popularity.",1
2015,"Ingenious atmospheric exploration game.Game design and sound are both well done. Both work well together to conjure up a mysterious but relaxing atmosphere. Encountered a jump scare in the first 20 minutes. Don't know why but I walked back into it and it happened again. Spooky. Great value for 49 cents (purchased during a sale).The headlight toggle element is very clever and easy to learn. Visuals are very nice to look at.I recommend this if you like atmospheric exploration games.Some suggestions to the developer:I found getting off of the top of some ladders to be very clumsy. Climbing upwards when hitting the top of the ladder should allow me enough height to jump off onto the ground on the other side. On some ladders, reaching the top made me jump a little bit but not enough to get over the ladder, so I found myself having to try repeatedly (playing with keyboard).Please add some sort of snapshot save feature. My first impression of the game is great but it might not be worth starting from the beginning if I didn't end up finishing a chapter.If practical, a game speed slider would be nice as my little diver walks quite slowly. I understand this may sacrifice some of the atmospheric element but I do not plan to ramp up the game speed much anyway. Just want to put a spring in his step.",1
2015,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IT WILL EXPLODE YOUR BRAIN! Apart from that, it is worth your money.Portal and Portal 2 is the one and only ""Perpetual Testing Initiative"" game which is a great success by Valve at exploding your brain. To win, you've got to think with Portals and potatoes and Wheatley. This game is humorous and contains a bunch on Eastereggs. What I didn't like about this game was Level 11. Wanna know why? Your gotta find out yourself. Apart from all that mumble-jumbo, I rate it 11 out of 10. Not bad when you have to work with a potato and the dumbest moron who ever lived!",1

If you have some spare money, or in the mood for a nice horror/thriller game. This is the one for you.

2015,"I cannot say much right now due to the game not even being in versions 1, and because of that there are only 4 gamemodes right now.   They are:-Mini Golf (Very fun, I didn't think I would enjoy the mini gold as much as it is strangely addicting)-Ball Race (Definitely a challenge but fun if done correctly)-Planet Panic (UFO Cats VS Dogs trying to retrieve as many 'animal pods' as possible to their base)-Virus ♥ (VERY fun to play especially with friends, though the crashing will occur especially on virus, and when it does it      is very annoying) On top of those gamemodes there is condo making which I am really getting into. Something about playing mini games based on skill and knowledge that rewards me with ingame currency that I can spend on making a nice home is oddly satisfying.Right now the player population isn't that big but from the people that I have spoken to they have been very nice and accepting of every player.So if you can get by the crashes, the fact that there might not be a certain gamemode with lots of people on it, the game only have 4 gamemodes and having a somewhat small population, why don't you come join us at the tower and support this game.I can assure you that the game blossum with your support.",1

2015,"As World War II progressed, it was obvious the Allies were going to be defeated. The Axis had been establishing their technological superiority at every turn, Great Britain was occupied by the German forces, and Stalin had been assassinated by German spies. The Soviet Union was broken, it's people scattered and turned into slaves by the tyrannical Führer's orders. The Japanese Empire, having suceeded in it's conquest of the Pacific, now moved it's fleets closer and closer to America itself. As the last Allied nation remaining, it was up to the US to fight, Fight for freedom before surrendering to opression. The joint japanese and german attack on America was brutal and efficient. Most coastal defenses were easily destroyed and, before most people even noticed it, the war was already lost.But, hope always remains. For a few brave people survived, daring to live for freedom, even under the combined oppression of the Reich and the Japanese Empire. Those few people would keep on preparing, preparing for when they would retake their lands. It was so that, in the mid 50s, news reached the Resistance. News of a Nazi weapon that would ensure the Reich would reign supreme for more than a thousand years. A time machine. A device that could supress a rebellion before it even began. If the world was to ever know freedom, such a machine should never be used by the nazis.it was a costly operation, but the Resistance had no choice. I must spare you here of the details, but, after many sacrifices, the Resistance seized the schematics for this ""Time machine"". Some sought to destroy them, but a young scientist saw it's potentials. he made a copy of the schematics, and worked tirelessly day and night in secret. Moving around, on the run from both the opressors and his fellow resistance fighters who believed that machine would doom us all.Finally, it was done. It was but a simple machine on the outside, and there was no knowing what would happen to one who used it. The young man gathered all his courage. This was something worth risking his life for. If he failed, the world would continue being opressed forever. The Resistance would never defeat the Reich. But this... This was the single hope for mankind's freedom. With a deep breath, he took a step inside the machine, carrying with him all his knowledges and schematics of his timeline's weapons of war.As he opened his eyes, he saw himself on a familiar place. It was his beloved hometown, once so beautiful, but now destroyed by nazi opression. That man that walked over there with a baby on his arms... Why did it resemble his father so much? The young man ran through the streets, snatching a newspaper from a nearby seller, barely able to contain his happiness. The year was 1931. The war had yet to start. This was his chance. He had a single chance to correct that which went wrong. With his knowledge from the future, he would change the course of the upcoming war.Through many troubles which I'll spare you, he reached the US Army and convinced it's high command to give him a chance. His knowledge helped the US beyond words could permit. Some schemati the young man drew ended up being stolen, and were years later found to be in the possession of communists, but that was a small price to pay for the advantages that single young man brought to the war effort.With his knowledges, US and USSR technology were years ahead of their time. They could work on german technology before the technology was even invented in Germany. They could throw planes that would be invented only years after in the war to aid them. And thus, the German war effort of Me 262s was utterly crushed by Sabres. Freedom was achieved thanks to the brave acts of those brave people who dared to defy tiranny even at the risk of their lives.",1

2015,"I found it to be a bit short, pretty sure that's obvious though. But holy hell this game, beautiful graphics, smooth (when PhysX is off) and generally good storyline. I personally feel taht the ending was anti-climatic, but it's easily overlooked by the game as a whole. Worth the money and time if you wanna play it.",1
2015,"I haven't gotten all the achievements, and there i didn't read each and every entry yet so my full experience has yet to be complete but i can review this with confidence regardless.This game is amazing, i cannot begin to describe how enjoyable i found it; from the voice acting to the scenery, it's utterly immersive. But i'll go through individually to break it down.The gameplay - This game features a first or third person perspective while you go about solving puzzles for things called ""sigils"", this is the core mechanic of the game, you MUST collect these to advance, which means you MUST solve the puzzles, and frankly speaking, it was very enjoyable. I found the puzzles were not overly tricky and most involve some planning ahead, but at no point was i dreading going to the next puzzle, it never got stale, so if you do puzzles then you'll enjoy this game off of that alone. HOWEVER, that is not the only thing this game is about, The Talos Principle is a philosophical adventure as well, you are continuously guided by a deep voice called ""Elohim"" and he openly states that he is the maintainer and creator of the world you're in and that you must go along as per his wishes to trancend to heaven; this however is met with an issue when you discover another person/entity on the computers found in every level named ""Milton"" or as he is referred to by Elohim ""the serpent"". As you progress Milton will continuously press you with really challenging and thought provoking questions and this is where this game really hooked me; i literally found myself battling with flaws in my ways of thinking, it's so mind tripping and intense and i love it. If you enjoy these things then you will also like the game.Soundtrack - The sounds in this game are really scenic and help solidify the mood of the various worlds, it will at times intensify during intermission worlds such as the A, B and C buildings and at other times mellow out such as during a few of the puzzles, it very effectively immersifies as well by simulating environments, such as birds chirping with a waterfall while playing slow deep based music to really get a calm feeling seeping into the player, i was thoroughly pleased with the use of sounds in this game, especially because you can play at your own place and i found myself just stopping and looking around nice and slowly at times to really enjoy this game. Scenery/asthetics - HOLY HELL, this game was amazing with its looks; granted at times my computer would start buffering because it was on Ultra, i found that even on high i was just completely immersed and mesmerised  by the scenery; it features a realatively large closed in map in all the worlds and the look is very convincing, to the point where you go to a place where a ""messenger"" is and it was just beautiful, easily one of my favorite places. Story - I will not be doing any spoilers or anything; there are 3 endings, i've done 2 of them with the last one not being done being the ""easiest"" to accomplish (cough, basic completion); and i found myself disappointed when it ended yet completely satisfied with the endings. This games quarrels between Elohim and Milton quite apparently mirrors the ""God vs Devil"" kind of storyline, but rather than telling the player who is good or who is bad, we are tasked with trusting our instincts and coming to our own conclusions. Throughout the game as well, we see many QR codes which are translated into messages, these messages are from other sigil seekers, and they show the very different outlooks people may have when faced with such a situation as either scepticism or complacency. This game has a simple plot overall, of that there is no doubt, but it's the characters and interactions with the environment that make this game great.  I've left this segment seperate, but this is also part of the story; You will find audio files, these files depict one Alexander Drennan, a person who shares her thoughts on the outlook of the world, human beings, and our creations. She touches on some deep and maybe depressing topics, but she does so effectively, she very much is, in my opinion, one of the most immersive and enjoyable aspects of the game, the voice actor Erin Fitzgerald did an amazing job voicing her and we learn the means that built up to The Talos Principle; i will not diverge into it, as i think that's part of the enjoyment and what builds a drive to find all the files and information. CONS:- There are things in the game called stars, they are what they sound like; golden stars. These things are hidden in almost every level of every Hub world (7*3) There are 30 in total, 3 are found in the Main transistional world where the tower lays. THESE THINGS ARE ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T, I'm not even joking, had i not looked up a tutorial to find them all, i would never have found them, you have to do the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t things, interact multiple puzzles with each other, find hidden passages, ladders and switches and frankly, it's just tedious. Through the stars you unlock 3 worlds, these worlds have 9 sigils in total that are needed for the secret ending; I very much dislike how ♥♥♥♥ing hidden and annoying they are, i didn't even know there were so many stars needed until about halfway through. Honestly a drag, you WILL need a guide for this.- It's a bit short a game; if you're only here for puzzles, then you will have such a short playthrough; the only reason i have 20 hours on record is due to doing everything with the exception of a few acheivements; this by no means stops it from being a great game, it really is, i would buy this full price, just be wary that if you truly want to draw everythign out of the game, take it slow, otherwise you will probably be disappointed.Of all of the games i've enjoyed, this game is damn near the top, I give it a 9/10 easy, i look forward to the DLC when i can afford it.****EDIT**** I've just completed the DLC Road to Gehenna, it is beautiful in its own way, it has the same atmosphere as the vanilla game, and obviously still has puzzles and <♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t> stars, but it also touches on a more existenal take, seeing many characters trapped in Elohim's prison. Going through all the messages on the boards, reading what they have and the community they've built, it really does show how society can really becomes this entangled mess. I wouldn't say it had the same impact as the vanilla, which i believe is due to the lack of voice over, (erin fitzgerald truley made the game a massive experience for me), and it definitely didn't touch much on the same existenal crisis that the vanilla did in my opinion. It was by no means disappointing, but if i hadn't have been so invested into the story of the vanilla, that i got all the endings (but the basic) then i don't think the DLC at full price (i got it during discount) would have been worth it in my opinion. I think the vanilla is the main meat of it, and the DLC wraps it in a nice little bow. Overall this game is phenomenal and i cannot stress that it will forever have a place in my heart and recommendation list.",1

2015,"This is one of the most legitimate mods I've ever seen hands down. Portal Stories: Mel is simply a YES if you finished Portal 2 and you need a new story and puzzle. There will be no ""tutorials"" unlike Portal 2, and you'll start with all the elements thrown at you in the beginning, so I recommend if you finish Portal 2 first.Be warned though, the puzzles are mostly hard and you will need to think more outside the box to figure it out. BUT, it will be very satisfying once you solve it, so gear up! You're in for some frustration and a whole bunch of Thinking With Portals. All Over Again! ;)Oh and also, the mod has all that you expect, Valve quality, so don't worry about it. You'll be fascinated. For Science!",2
2015,"Tree of Savior is what you expect. A true successor of the so called Ragnarok Online. For this review, I'll be writing on paragraphs divided by pros and cons. I played through ICBT, so I can tell a lot from my point of view.Pros:ToS has a huge amount of options for classes. Large variety of classes and combinations that will most likely suit what kind of class you want best. The adventure is long and grindy, but it's always enjoyable, especially with friends, as you wander around a world masterpiece. The game is very deep too, the level cap is more than 200. The mechanics are mostly Keyboard / Controller based; hitting the enemies are manual. Positioning and tactics matter a lot. Attacks deal in an AoE. It's a step up from Ragnarok's combat mechanics mostly. If you want to go back to the ol' times of MMORPG, ToS is for you.Cons:The biggest problem I have with ToS at the current state is poor optimization. It's said that even the high-end users find the performance to be worse than it should be. For low-end users, crashes are very common due to instability. Everyone should have a stable 60 FPS for high-end PC, and 30 FPS for low-end PC.Also, the story is linear although more variety. You either start from Klaipeda or Orsha, but both are linear in nature.If you don't want to grind, no, this game is not for you.Verdict:7/10. As long as the optimization issue is not fixed, I cannot give this game a high score just yet. I really hope they will fix this up in the near future. It's worth giving a try either way, though :)",2

2015,"Whilst everyone was 'hyped' about to sequel to CA's invincible Rome: Total War, I was patient. I didn't rush ahead and pre-purchase a game that could be either really impressive or unstable/un-playable. Coincidently it turned out upon release that the game was terrible (cough* cough* rushed by SEGA as evident in other titles cough* cough* COH2). So i waited; regulary reading reviews, watching gameplay and dev changelogs. I then purchased the game when the emperor editon was released. Instantaniously, the ratio of positive and negative reviews was leaning towards the positive approach. So i purchased the game  with the Greek states DLC on a steam sale Sepember last year for a great price of $20.At that point in which i purchased the game i was impressed, beautiful graphics, animations and mechanics which were not exactly historically accurate but were enjoyable and rewarding. If i had any negative comeents at this current stage, it would be the numerous overpriced DLCs which i believe was influenced by SEGA (cough* cough* COH2 has the same issue). Another complaint is the weakness of the Greek Hoplite/Pike phalanx. I do not like the fact that sword beats the dori phalanx as historically if a unit collided head on with a phalnx, they would become what is known as the modern day souvlaki. I rate this game 92/100 at its CURRENT stage.",2

2014,"The game is pretty fun, the graphics are great and the gameplay is pretty interesting. -Free Roam-Great Combat Mechanic-Easy keyboard controls-Puzzles-Stealth-And of course, you play as batman (and other characters with boobs)You play as Batman in Arkham City, fighting criminals and saving yourself from a danger (Don't wanna spoil it.)You fight famous and noticeable enemies such as Joker, Harley Quinn, Dr Freeze, Penguin and of course, Two Face.After you finish the game, you are allowed to free-roam, beat people up and just do something Batman would (or wouldn't) do. I haven't seen anything bad about this game. It's hard to navigate through places sometimes or you don't know where to go.

2015,"The Witcher is an action role-playing hack and slash video game developed by CD Projekt RED and published by Atari, Inc. The game is based on the book series of the same name by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. The Witcher takes place in a medieval fantasy world and follows the story of Geralt, one of the few remaining ""witchers"" – traveling monster hunters for hire, gifted with unnatural powers. The combat system in The Witcher represents a much different gaming experience from most RPGs. Players can choose one of three fighting styles to use in different situations and against different foes. The fast style allows for faster, less-damaging attacks with a greater chance of hitting faster enemies; the strong style deals much more damage in exchange for a slow attack speed, and a lower chance to hit faster enemies; and the group style features sweeping attacks best used if Geralt is surrounded. Both of Geralt's main swords also have the distinctively different combat styles from other weaponry, and serve specific purposes. The steel blade is used to fight humans and other flesh-and-blood beings, while the silver sword is much more effective against supernatural monsters and beasts (against some of which steel may have no effect on them whatsoever). With precise timing, the player can link Geralt's attacks into strong combos to more effectively damage enemies. Alchemy is a major part of gameplay.  The player can create potions that increase health or endurance regeneration, allows Geralt to see in the dark, or provide lots of other beneficial effects. The recipes for these potions can be learned through reading scrolls, or by experimentation. Once the player creates an unknown potion he can choose to drink it, but if a potion is a failure it will poison or have other harmful effects on Geralt. In addition to potions, the player can create oils used to augment the damage done by weapons. Players can also create bombs for use as weapons in combat. Neither can be created until talent points have been allocated into the corresponding skills. My overall rating for The Witcher Enhanced Edition is 10/10 the story is really interesting and also fun to play through, the gameplay and combat also feels very very realistic. Next to Dragon Age: Origins this is most definitely one of the best RPG games I have ever played. I highly recommend you get this game I am sure you will be blown away with how fantastic this game is. So once again I really recommend you get this game because I am absolutely without a single doubt 100% sure that The Witcher Enhanced Edition will not disappoint you at all!.",1
2015,"There is absolutely no other words I can say about this game it is just magnificent. Fallout: New Vegas is based in a post-apocalyptic, open world environment around the area of Nevada, California, and Arizona. You take control of the character known as the Courier, who is hired by a delivery service to take an unknown package across the Mojave Desert to Las Vegas Strip but is intercepted, shot in the head, and left for dead by a mysterious man who steals the package. After being found by a friendly local robot, Victor, and healed by a man named Doc Mitchell, the Courier is thrust back into the desert to seek revenge and recover the stolen package. By doing this, you become caught between various factions competing for control over the desert and its most valuable asset, the Hoover Dam, ultimately coming to shape the future of its inhabitants. Fallout: New Vegas's combat is centered around the ""Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System"" feature, or ""V.A.T.S."", which is from Fallout 3 with the addition of several new V.A.T.S.-specific attacks. Fallout: New Vegas now allows you to have firearm modifications such as mounted telescopic sights, rate of fire modifiers and increased magazine size. Crafting also plays a role in weaponry, with the ability to make ammunition such as hand-loaded rounds.A plant-harvesting system similar to that of The Elder Scrolls series allows you to use plants to create special meals, poisons, and medicines. Fallout: New Vegas reintroduces the reputation system that was absent in Fallout 3. The degree of faction loyalty influences your reputation with that faction, which affects the behavior of the faction's non-player characters (NPCs) towards you and reflects the impact of selected choices in the world. Karma is also a factor and is independent of faction reputation. Overall I give Fallout: New Vegas a score of 10/10 the story and gameplay are just absolutely outstanding it is definitely a huge step up from the previous Fallout games as it is able to feature loads of new content while still retaining features from the previous FO games. I really cannot recommend this game to you enough it is just absolutely outstanding in everyway. I am absolutely 100% sure that Fallout: New Vegas will not disappoint you in anyway!.",1
2010,"PAYDAY The Heist is just fantastic. The game focus on four robbers Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf who team up. Their first heist took place at the First World Bank, where they entered a vault by using thermite hidden on the inside of a photocopier and stole a large amount of money. A post-game message congratulates the group, telling them that they are ""set for life"", but recommends more heists, including robbing drug junkies in an abandoned apartment complex and ambushing a prisoner transport in heavy rain weather, simply for the enjoyment. This is the game before PAYDAY 2 and if you have not played PAYDAY 2 this game will be completely new to you. Although PAYDAY The Heist does not have a proper story the main objective of the game is to perform heists either by yourself on single player or you can invite your friends to join you in co-op mode. The co-op mode in PAYDAY is fantastic it works very well as they have same maps just this time you're not alone but with friends. You and your friends will have to complete a number of objectives while also holding of the police while the drill does its job and once the vault is open you can escape with the money. The gameplay is fantastic being like a GTA just without the openworld and in a first person view. Overall I give this game a score of 10/10 both the singleplayer and co-op mode are very fun. So if you're looking to get a PAYDAY game I really really recommend you get this one as it is a very enjoyable game and I am absolutely one hundred percent sure it will not disappoint you at all!.",1
2015,"Far Cry 3 is an open world, action-adventure first-person shooter video game set on a tropical island between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. After a vacation goes awry, protagonist Jason Brody must save his friends, who have been kidnapped by pirates and escape from the island and its unhinged inhabitants. Far Cry 3 is a first-person shooter, which also features role-playing game elements including experience points, skill trees, and a crafting system. Far Cry 3 gives you the ability to take cover behind objects to break enemies' lines of sight and to peek around and over cover and blindfire. You are also able to perform silent takedowns by performing melee attacks from above, below, or close behind. Equipment is controlled by a simple system. As missions are completed, new items are unlocked to be purchased or crafted by Jason, using the pelts of various animals that are found around the island. As the outposts of Vaas' pirate group are attacked and retaken, the vicinity around the outpost becomes safer, it unlocks new side quests for that area, involving missions like hunting the many different wildlife species on the island to upgrade ones equipment. Skills are collected by gaining experience from completing missions and killing enemies, and are unlocked in three skill trees, which correspond to the Spider, the Heron, and the Shark. Each skill tree upgrades different aspects of Jason's abilities, with the Spider upgrading his stealth takedowns and hunting skills, Shark for assault takedowns and health, with the Heron upgrading Jason's long-range takedowns and mobility. As skills are collected, the tattoo on Jason's forearm grows which is made up of several different tribal designs resembling the three animal skill trees. With all the new features that Ubisoft has added to Far Cry 3 I really think that this is definitely a huge improvement to the previous Far Cry games. The story is very interesting and fun, the island you explore is very big and beautifully detailed and there is so many things you can do when your bored, for example there are loads of side-missions and hunting contracts scattered around the island. Overall Far Cry 3 absolutely deserves a score of 10/10 it is just truly fantastic, I'm definitely 100% sure that Far Cry 3 will not disappoint you in anyway!.",1
2015,"Batman: Arkham Knight is an action-adventure video game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Set one year after the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman Arkham City, the game's main storyline follows Batman as he confronts the Scarecrow, who has launched an attack on Gotham City, causing a city-wide evacuation. Aided by the mysterious Arkham Knight, the Scarecrow unites Batman's greatest foes in a plot to finally kill the Dark Knight. Batman Arkham Knight is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets that can be used in both combat and exploration. Batman: Arkham Knight now introduces Batman's car, the Batmobile, as a driveable vehicle. The bulletproof Batmobile can be summoned to the your location at your will while on foot, or, if airborne, the car can now be sent to meet Batman just as he lands, it can also be used for combat against the Arkham Knight's tanks or just for transportation around Gotham City. Batman: Arkham Knight is set within Gotham City, which is open for you from the beginning of the game allowing you to travel freely anywhere within its boundaries. Many of the gadgets and lots of gameplay elements from the previous Arkham games have returned, including the grapnel gun, line launcher, batarangs, a countering system and the detective vision, which is like Batman's own version of Eagle vision. Changes to the combat system include the ability to now combine attacks on prone enemies without interrupting the streak. Batman can now counter enemy attacks and throw them into other enemies for increased damage. Overall I would say that Batman: Arkham Knight is definitely a step up from previous games, yes the game has a terrible optimization and quite a lot of FPS issues, but the story and gameplay are just fantastic, I really think the Batmobile is definitely a nice new feature of the game. I recommend getting this game when it has been fixed, it is not really that playable at the moment. I would give this game a rating of 8/10 it's absolutely fantastic, I am just absolutely 100% sure without even a single doubt that Batman: Arkham Knight will just blow away all your expectations!!.",1
2015,"Fallout 4 is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth major installment in the Fallout series, and my personal favorite!. It is set in a post-apocalyptic Boston in the year 2287, 210 years after a devastating nuclear war. The player character emerges from an underground nuclear fallout shelter known as Vault 111, and subsequently explores the world, completes various quests and acquires experience points to level up their character. You have the ability to roam anywhere on the map, and leave a conversation at any time. You also have the ability to customize weapons; the game includes over 50 base guns, which can be crafted with a variety of modifications, such as barrel types and laser focus, with over 700 modifications available. Power Armor has been redesigned to be more like a vehicle than an equipable suit of armor and can be modified, allowing you to add items such as a jetpack or selecting separate types of armor for each part of the suit.Returning features from Fallout 3 include a camera that can switch between a first-person and third-person perspective, and the ability to roam anywhere on the map. Fallout 4 introduces new features including a layered armor system, base-building, a dynamic dialogue system featuring 111,000 lines of dialogue, an in-depth crafting system which implements every lootable object in the game, and much more. Enemies such as mole rats, raiders, super-mutants, deathclaws, and feral ghouls along with the companion Dogmeat return in Fallout 4. The Pip-Boy, a personal computing device strapped to the character's wrist, allows you to access a menu with statistics, maps, data, and items. You can find game cartridges, which can be played on the Pip-Boy. Another returning gameplay feature is the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.), which plays an important part in combat. While using V.A.T.S., real-time combat is slowed down, and action is played out from varying camera angles in a computer graphics version of ""bullet time"".  Various actions cost action points, limiting the actions of each combatant during a period of time, and you can target specific body parts for attacks to inflict specific injuries.Overall I think Fallout 4 really is one of the best RPGs I've played so I am going to give it a 10/10. It is absolutely fantastic, the world you can explore is filled side quests and loads of settlements. The stunning skyrim like graphics also make the world look very detailed and stunning even on the lowest settings (if you play it on that). Fallout 4 is also very well optimized only needing 24gb HD space and being able to run almost smoothly on Max settings, even on laptops and computers that have outdated graphics card (like my GeForce 840m card). So if you're looking for a fun and entertaining open world RPG game or if you have played Fallout 3 and enjoyed it, this is the game for you it's just outstanding, a huge improvement!.",1

2015,"UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings",2

You are one of the best games I have played in the last few months, Rust is honestly one of the most fun survival games on the market.You spawn somewhere random on the map, with a rock, torch and a couple of bandages... Completely naked. This game is soooo much more fun with a friend as you can make a big house like I did. Although it has it's many bugs it is still easily worth the $20.

Loot barely spawns, and when you do find something decent you will probably be shot by another player in one of the taller buildings or you will be killed by the TELEPORTING nethers. I honestly wanted this game to be good, the concept is cool, the monsters are scary but the developers didn't quite pull it off. What you are paying into is:-A pay-to-win style game-A lagfest-Scenery that looks like it was made by a five year-oldAt the moment I can't recommend this game. It is fun to play with a friend for a couple of hours, but it gets very boring after a while. Save up another $5-$10 and buy a game which is more stable and fun like DayZ or Rust.3/10",1

Single player however does get boring very fast a must play game with friends or online. Would strongly recommend if you enjoy games like SC1/2!",1
2015,"A very immersive game, although the combat system gets a bit boring after awhile there are many many user created mods that can help improve upon the basic combat system adding more spells and what not. This is a MUST play game if love adventuring, I think i played 30-40 hours or roaming around exploring (including user added mods) and less than half that time doing the main story line, the main story line is actually rather fun as well! However the thing that keeps me playing this game, the user created mods like ive said before they add so much to this game. 100% would recommend to anyone even at full price",1

2015,"A great game so far! Really fun to play with friends. The cartoon graphics bring a very nostalgic feel to the whole game, the idea of a tower defense game with a mix of ""fps"" style to it is great! I would recommend this game if youre looking for a fun game to play with mates, a great coop game! My main criticism is it does lack complexity particularly with your talent tree, I would love to see an introduction of a more complex talent tree and a bit more varitey with tower upgrades / spells. However this game is still awesome and has alot of potential, can't wait to see where they take this game!",1
2015,"Edited review, great game having alot of  fun however getting a few random crashes probably just release jitters nothing to be worried about.. the only issue i have is the combat system very much just mouse spam without a huge amount of varitey.

2015," Written for an assessment at  SAE Institute Brisbane! [sae.edu.au] I myself am an avid player of immersive space simulators, and Rodina is a simple, yet brilliant addition to my much beloved genre. Rodina is already full of great features, and has excellent potential in terms of the endless possibilities for the modding side of it. Even though Rodina consists of only one system, it has the potential to habitat so much inside of it.The flight and combat in the game is very enjoyable. The movement is all inertia based, and the weapons look and feel amazing. Shooting down enemies high and the atmosphere, and watching them fall out of view, knowing that you could fly all the way down there and find some wondrous mountain range where the ship crashes, makes the game feel extremely grand. Its story is basic at first, but I suspect it will later develop, which gives purpose to exploring and fighting the large amounts of enemies. The feeling of flying straight out of space and onto a planets surface, while dealing with the fear of burning up in the atmosphere build so much tension and requires focus, particularly on the higher difficulties. Once you are on the surface, and have fought off any enemies in the area, you can land and walk around your ship and the planet, you can even edit the layout of your ship. You can see some great sights exploring on the surface of planets, though, in its current state the surface of a planet/asteroid/planetoid gets a bit repetitive after a while. As with most immersive space games, watching the day start, go by, and end on an alien planet is something that gets most immersive space game fans worked up (and anyone who enjoys something beautiful), what makes it even better is knowing that you can go do it all again on another planet.This game is already a great experience, for a very low price, even if a short lived one. I am excited to see it as it progresses through development, and we get to see some more incredible sights from an alien system.",2

2015,"I've had my heart broken several times in my life. Once, on Christmas Day 1989, I eagerly ran downstairs and gasped at the sight of what was clearly a crudely but lovingly wrapped skateboard. A skateboard that I had wanted ever since I had seen Marty McFly cruise through the streets of Hill Valley as a stowaway behind an unsuspecting SUV driver. A skateboard with a custom deck, with artwork that would cause my fellow skaters to shout ""rad"". A skateboard whose wheels would send me gliding across the streets as I headed for the nearest half-pipe. A skateboard of majestical proportion.I grabbed it, and with shaking hands and a heart beating against my chest, I tore that festive wrapping as hard as I could. Through an intricate web of sticky tape, ribbon and ever expanding wrapping paper, I dug through. Years later, I wondered that this is what Andy in The Shawshank Rdemption must have felt like as he dragged hinself through the tunnels. My own redemption was in sight. My prize was near. Finally, the last shred of packaging fell away to the floor. And there it was... a plastic skateboard from the local store. With stiff plastic wheels. And a picture of a clown on the deck. That's what playing ORION: Dino Horde felt like.",1

2015,"New fans may not enjoy this game. I've had the pleasure of growing up with the Xeen, Eye of the beholder and other turn based games. Here you will find updated graphics but this game does miss out on modern boss mechanics. A few of these moments exists in the game but this was a missed opportunity by the developers. Everything else in this game is true to the previous series. You will need to save often and build a balanced party (Tank, DPS, Healer and Mage). I finished 1 play through with Paladin (Tank), Barbarian (DPS), Ranger (DPS/Heal with Regen) and Freemage (Heal/AOE/ Damage mitigation spells).8/10 if scoring for older fans",1

2015,Metal Gear Rising Revengeance isnt your average Metal Gear game. The stealth that you are used to in the old metal gear solid games have been completly dropped. There are still little sections with a touch of stealth but there is barley any stealth. Its more a hack and slash game but a dam good one. Keep in mind that Platnium Games made the game. Kanomi only published the game. Still this is one spin of game that is worth a shot. The soundtrack is freakin BADASS and fits each battle perfectly. I suggest you play with a controller as a keyboard and mouse is kind of shonky. I havent finished the game but im past half way and im having a great experience. You dont have to have played any of the previous Metal Gear games to understand whats going on. Definiatly worth giving it a shot.,1

2015,"When games become a expirience it exceeds all expectation and fairness.UNDERTALE is a innovative JRPG with a lot of heart and love. The concept of UNDERTALE is the battle system. The battle system spins the generic overused reference of a battle system which was pioneered by Final Fantasy and makes it ironic. In UNDERTALE you have the ability to talk with your enemies instead of fighting them. This leads into some very interesting gameplay that never gets old. Trying to find the correct option to talk them out of battle is puzzle like and you feel very accomplished when you advance the battle through talking. If talking isn't your thing you can slash your enemies to death just like every other JRPG out there. The game's charm is just heartwarming, its filled with so many things that can make you laugh, make you  determined, make you disturbed by the occasional chilling atmosphere, it's litterally a rollercoaster of many different emotions. The little secrets and references show how effort went into this, these secrets didn't even have to be in the game but they are there and adds so much heart. The story has a simple setting of you are a human child who falls down into the underground where its filled with monsters who have been banished there by humans. It's a simple story and the opening prologue resembles that of a NES game but the plot darkens and goes even further beyond. Apparently UNDERTALE's main inspiration is Earthbound (Mother) and for a person who has not played Earthbound can definitely see it the graphics. The music is GOD LIKE its all catchy and atmospheric, its a real highlight of the game.IN CONCLUSIONUNDERTALE is a  short innovative expirience that can touch your heart with its charm, and is worth the $10 PLS PLAY IT.If I had any problems with it, it would be it's length. Its about 5-11 hour game depending on what you know, and the world could have been so much more then the very limited amount of locations. But this minor ""dislike"" gets ruled out when you realise its an Indie game that was mostly made by one Toby Fox so of course the game isn't going to be huge.anyway just click add to cart and play.",2

My response was ""Why dont we go jump in a pit of fire and burn to death, it would be just as fun"". But seriously I didn't enjoy this and here is my list of pros and consPros-Large expansive maps with lots of people which could be fun-The graphics can be nice if you don't look at the textures to closelyCons-Game starts you off with a very poorly done tutorial that can teleport you every place you don't need to be. I had to noclip to escape some of places I was thrown into-The tutorial is also confusing and frustrating if it decides to work-Even after the tutorial I still had hope maybe the rest of the gameplay was differenand less glitchy and sometimes confusing, the game was littered with latency issues as well as the forementioned issues that appeared in the tutorial-Also to me the gameplay felt like it was just trying to board the success of other modern FPS'All in all this game was a disappointing which is saying something cause I went in with 0 expectation. It felt unfinished and like a rip-off of an already overdone concept.",1

I feel dirty for even having it in my library.Judging by his Twitter, the developer seems 12 years old and is already off to a great start in life by outright scamming people with this ""game"".

Since then there has been no regret to buying this product, the graphics have greatly improved, the gameplay is tighter and faster paced and the humour is nearly original Portal level in my opinion with lots of clever quips and references that you have to really see and search for.There is one thing however that must be though of when purchasing this, make sure you have a friend to play it with because as with any game that requires a bit of grinding a friend goes a long way to seperating boredom from adventures into hilarity.A geniunely good game if you do not mind the occasional What the Heck!!!! moments from enemies.",2

It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.""Where do I start?"" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm..._The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more._Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore._Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds._Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want._My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Story: N/ASound: 8/10Replayability: 10/10Overall 8.5Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

2015,"Holy Crap.Prepare for a long rant.7 Days to Die, what the hell, Fun Pimps?I bought this game maybe 2/3 years ago because some youtuber played it and I thought it looked fun, and guess what, it was pretty fun!Then they released some update that ruined it's compability for me, and i uninstalled it, and forgot about it for a few years.Now I looked in my 'Bad Games' category on my steam library and saw it again, and I remembered that it existed, i looked at the store page and found Mostly Positive Reviews, which confused me.Regardless, i decided to give it a shot again, who knows, it might be good again.Here's what happened.-------------PRE GAMING---------------I launched the game, it took around 7 actual real life minutes of real time before the Main Menu screen loaded up, which is always a good sign, but I pressed on, doubt weighing on my mind.Fixed some settings, and was confused for around 3 minutes at the default Resolution it gave me. 1024 x 751.751 ??!?!?, what kind of a resolution is that man?Character Creator, it's amazing how many unnessecary options there are, like foot size sliders, and it's also just as amazing how every character looks the same, no matter how you customize the face.I finally decided to start a game, which scared me as it took around 4 minutes to load the main menu, how long would it take to generate a world?I noticed it finally has randomly generated worlds now, so that's good, i guess.It took around 2 minutes to load the game, and when i was thrown into the game I realised it was slower than a drunk snail and i had to lower even more settings.Now you may think, 'it's just your computer bro', and on any other game i'd agree with you, but My crappy computer can run Skyrim with 200+ mods, Fallout New Vegas with 200+ mods, and Saints Row 2 just fine, so i'd expect a small little survival game in alpha would be able to run smoothly at medium.Nope, dead wrong there, and even on the lowest possible settings, it still froze for about a minute every few minutes or so.Finally, after i changed the settings and waited around 5 minutes for them to take place, I could finally start the gaming.-------------GAMING---------------I was met with a quest to make a stone axe, and after searching around for plant fibers which I could not find for the life of me, i collected everything else i needed, i noticed while running away from a bear i had collected the fibers somehow even though i hadn't actually found any? I dont know.I finally decided to make the axe, and with a relatively fast moving zombie on my tail and around 70 health left, i quickly spammed the keyboard, looking for the magical inventory button, which the game comveniently never told me what it was, i had to look in the controls menu before i found out it was defaulted to 'Tab', of course.I finally made my axe, 'Now i can kill those rotting, jerkily moving zombies!' i thought to myself, and i started to swing at the zombie who followed me, and after about 10 swings he finally hit the floor.Then, a nurse zombie hit me 3 times and i died, and while the screen went black, i could hear nothing but the very loud screeches of zombies as the game tried to load me into a new area.Luckily, I had set it so i would keep my toolbar upon death, so i didn't lose my half broken axe when i spawned into a desert, however, the game had decided that I was a complete f***ing idiot for dying (you idiot), and had reduced my max health and stamina to 89 points, which i found absolutely ridiculous, way to punish confused players struggling with lag.So anyway, I set out into the desert, and stumbled upon a lone zombie, who i tried to kill.Again, after 12 or so swings he finally fell to the ground, and there was me, bleeding out on 27hp after maybe 2 hits from him.I encountered another zombie by itself and tried to kill it, and died in one hit.Spawned in again, and the game must really think i'm incompetent because it graciously provided me with 79hp this time instead. After exploring a bit I found an abandoned town, and tried to set up camp in a house, the door was broken, so I destroyed it and tried to build a new one, but the game obviously thought i was doing it too correctly, and rotated it so it faced towards the doorframe, and not towards the outside or inside.By that point I had had enough, and I quit.-------------FINAL THOUGHTS---------------Good job, Fun Pimps, you really know how to drop the ball.This game costs around $30, and the awful thing is, it used to cost more.I bought it, and the very day after, they had reduced the price permantely, so that's fun, but I enjoyed it, and i had fun.But then they did something and it made the game awful, like genuinely awful.This game is ugly, badly put together, it is almost unplayable on lowest settings for me, and I can play skyrim with over 200 mods and still have that run smoothly, the game is unfair on the default, normal difficulty and the zombies are jerky, not in a 'this is supposed to look like this' way, they're just badly animated and jerky, you die too quickly and the game takes away from your base health if you die.If I can do anything with this review, it will be to dissuade someone from getting this thing.It's honestly less of a game and more of a money laundering scheme, i mean come on, 2+ years and still in alpha?I'm probably not going to be able to get a refund on this but i'm sure as hell going to try, and if I can stop at least one person from getting this game and making the same mistakes as I did, I will be happy.1/10 - It used to be ok.Good luck and Happy Gaming.-Zanoscar",1

2015,"Lacks the diversity of mechanics that is essential to the tower defense genre. Only three upgrade levels per weapon, and only two weapon slots leaves the player with a feeling of disconnection from excitement. Towers can only be placed in specific locations, often lacking strategic value and drawing out excessive effort for almost no payout.",1
2015,"I would have started this review with a recomendation but turns out the automatic banning system they have set up is flawed online. I recieved an automatic ban until the end of the year while I throwing grenades at police helicopters. Disputed it, explained my story and asked for a reason for the ban. My post was edited to ""This is a complaint about ban"", responded with an automatic message explaining that they have an automatic banning system in place and the terms of use then deleted a day later. Tired asking again, demanded a reason for the ban. I then got an email that my account is now flagged for breaching terms of use. I wish there was a way to get my damn money back because they can apparently ban you without notice or reason. Not happy >:(TL;DROnline mode monitored by a flawed automatic ban hammer and will never get reviewd or get a response that isn't a pre-typed message",0

2015,"The shortest, most addictive game you can own.",2
2015,"The delevoper Jagex has since really started tweeking the game in all the wrong places, not what it used to be! Still fun but not as good as the day it was released - they're trying to over complicate a simple concept. No LAN support and they control all the servers. This advice stands even if the game is on sale.",2
2015,"A co-op game where team work is paramount, you can go in loud and spray all the ammo available to you or you can be the tactician and go in quiet.From personal experience Overkill Software/Starbreeze offer great support and really listen when it comes to addressing bugs, glitches, and cheaters.The stock standard game on its own is absolutely excellent and will have you hooked once you level up a few times.Overkill regularly offer free and paid DLC to further expand to game, I'm not a fan of DLC in general but this content isn't part of the game they left out but rather a genuine expansion to the options in game.",2

2015,Very funny game and highly recommended for South Park fans just don't buy the 'Low Violence' version.If you're in the following countries:GermanyAustriaAustraliaSingaporeHong Kong & TaiwanYour game will be censored.If this is the case I recommend importing the game from the USA or if you're happy with a fix refer to the following link to get around the censored content;http://steamcommunity.com/app/213670/discussions/0/558749824588892365/,2
1997,After playing this game for an hour I went to surf the internet and I was still trying to move in time to the beat of the game 10/10,0
2015,"This game has been in my library for quite some time, only when a friend recommended this that I started playing it one bored afternoon. I'm quite open to games but nonetheless I honestly thought this game was going to be boring after browsing through the store page. But seeing that it was recommended to me and that it's also got great reviews, I decided to start it. I didn't know what to expect, the game starts off a bit confusing as it's premise was very new to me, and I'm sure it  will be as well for some of you. What caught my attention and....emotions was the characters, their decisions, motivations and story. It all got me curious and I continued on wanting to learn more as I also got attached to them, some scenes are very heartwarming and sweet and others are innocent and depressing. The way the story is laid out in terms of memory links creates a very interesting and strong medium that makes it very easy to relate and observe the characters from. The game was never frustrating and you'll definitely find yourself pausing occasionally, if you're like me that enjoys a good soundtrack whilst revering the scenes and characters.This is certaintly a great game, if you are looking for a great story, short game with a great soundtrack, I'll also highly recommend this to you.",1

Turn onto a wire rack to cool completely. Use a large serrated knife to cut the cake horizontally into 3 even layers.Step 2Drain the cherries, reserving 160ml (2/3 cup) of the juice. Reserve 10 cherries to decorate. Place the remaining cherries and the reserved juice in a saucepan with the sugar and cornflour. Stir over medium-low heat until the mixture boils and thickens. Transfer to a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge to chill.Step 3Use an electric beater to beat cream in a medium bowl until firm peaks form.Step 4Place kirsch, water and extra sugar in a jug and stir until the sugar dissolves.Step 5Place 1 cake layer on a serving plate and drizzle over half of the kirsch mixture. Spread with half of the cherry mixture and a thin layer of the cream. Repeat with the remaining cake, kirsch mixture, cherry mixture and cream, finishing with a layer of cake.Step 6Spread some of the remaining cream over the top and side of the cake. Sprinkle the chocolate over the top and gently press onto the side of the cake.Step 7Place the remaining cream in a piping bag fitted with a 1cm fluted nozzle and pipe rosettes around the edge of the cake.Step 8Arrange the reserved cherries around the cake between the cream rosettes. Cut the cake into wedges to serve.THERE ARE YOU FU*KING HAPPY NOW!!!!!!",1

2015,"the game is brilliant, when your leaving your little shelter that you whacked together you have to always be on the lookout for other players and/or dangerous animals, then you get shot from somewere when somone is trying to blame you for something and holding you up....' give me everything you have now!'.......you give him nearly everything in your inventory.....*BANG BANG*....shoots you anyway, thats why you have to be careful about other players... you can never know who to trust but if you can play with friends or make a alliece with someone you can be better off with tradeing resourses or defending your area. you always have to be upgradeing your base and/or area.... banits in numbers from 1-15 ( depends on how big your base/town is) will rush in and try to raid the place and take all the resourses and trash the base, defently on big servers. a firearm is very good for defence/ attacking but everyone will learn that if you only have one gun.... dont go walking around with it because if you die.... youve lost your defence and you cant be respected by other people with a firearm, then theres the KOS players that dont care if you literly just sapwned in the game, they will shoot you for the pleasure. and there the ultra friendly people you get you started with some food and a tool when you join the game. In all rust is a very good game, if you like games like minecraft, DayZ, 7 days to die, all those crafting and survival games, Rust is defently the game for you, it is awesome, anywere from 20 players vs 20 player wars ,from building a local town and a anti-bandit force, its great. then you have the 'lone rangers', who work completly by themselves and dont go near other people, its still fun but its much better with friends or in game alliences....end result- AWSOME GAME, worth the money you pay for it, AND ITS STILL IN ALPHA!!, once this game it complete it will be so good.- ZeuXFi",1

The gameplay and visual style of the game is similiar to Red Orchestra 2\Rising Storm, although there are several unique elements involving trench based combat and some unorthodox class loadouts (get used to using handguns and revolvers, which are quite handy in some circumstances). Getting your head around these unique elements might take a few hours and you'll probably die a lot, much like the real inexperienced soldiers of WW1, but after gaining a bit of experience Verdun is a very exciting and rewarding gaming experience.Highly Recommended unless you suck at games",1

2011,"Stranded deep is an extremely promising early access game that needs to add more variety and features.I had been waiting for stranded deep for a LONG time before it's early access release. It was the perfect type of game for me. When it came out I did not enjoy it as much as i thought i would. Don't get me wrong, I REALLY like the game, but I just can't bring myself to love it, and that's because of one thing.Stranded deep is a very good early access game, it runs exetremely well, rarely crashes. It does have a substantial amount of bugs but most of these are just funny and do not take away from the game, and the bad ones are removed within one patch. The game looks amazing and is such a good idea, and now all the developers need to do is add more things to the game. As of now, the game is very simple. You go from island to island, explore wrecks, collect loot, build bases, deal with wildlife, deal with weather, collect food & water and survive. This is exactly what the description of the finished game should be (plus escape back home, or any other cool things the developers can think of), it just needs to be fleshed out. There needs to be more types of everyhting. More wrecks (maybe even caves or other natural exploration areas), more loot, better base building, more (and interesting) wildlife, and in my opinion the most important of all: more types of islands, besides the generic, tiny palm tree islands. I would love to see tiny sandbars, or a massive jungled island, or a grassy island, or a large desert island.Overall, I would reccomend you this game the way i would reccommend any good (emphasise good) early access game. If it looks interesting to and you want to get in on the developement or just join in as the game develops, I would highly reccommend it.",1
2015,"This game is just incredible. The graphics are some of the best I've ever seen (and it still runs like hipsters to an apple store), the combat and other gameplay mechanics are top notch, the story is engaging and the characters are unique, memorable, and most of all I cared about them.The world is so beautiful yet so dark. Geralt, while at first seeming shallow is actually a deep and layered character, and you as a player need to make some interesting moral choices that are actually about something other than which faction to join, or who lives and dies.If you are worried that a game so good can't possibly be long, you're wrong. I sunk nearly 100 hours into the base game alone, and you could EASILY do a lot more if you get into Gwent, or do many of the side missions I'm sure I missed.Although technically an open world game, the Withcer 3 is not a sandbox. It is a story driven game, and while open for you explore and do side missions, the entire game is finely crafted, and everything you do has it's won intricate story.I don't normally like to assign arbitrary number scores to things, but seriously:10 out of 10.My favourite game of all time.",1
2015,"It really, really pains me to say this, but I just can't recommend Fallout 4.I was so excited for this game, and for a while after it came out, I had Phantom Menace Syndrome. Over time, I have realised that it's not that good.Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell isn't bad. The game from a purely technical level it pretty great.On paper, the game seems like it'd be really good; good graphics, massive and incredible detailed world, improved gunplay and great crafting systems. It's just as an overall experience, Fallout 4 feels incredible average, and something you do not need to play.I'm sure there are a million small reasons why, but I think it really boils down to the RPG mechanics.  They are, admittedly simple, although I do not think that's a bad thing at all. Skyrim had simple RPG mechanics and that's one of the best RPG games of all time. No, the real problem with Fallout 4's RPG mechanics is a simple one: your skills don't improve from playing.The reason the RPG mechanics worked so well in Skyrim is that when you did something, you got better at it. A very simple reward for trying new playstyles, or sticking with one. And if you enjoyed that skill enough, every level you could spend a skill point to unlock interesting abilities, or massively upgrade your effectiveness in that skilll.In Fallout 4, you don't improve jsut from doing things, and per-level skill points are used for interesting abilities, and basic progression. And it's that which I think is at the core of Fallout 4's issues. There is no reward for doing things, and you feel cheated every time you can't get a cool new perk everytime you need to spend the skill point on basic progression.This dampens the experience massively, and combined with it's other issues, makes Fallout 4, while not bad, an incredible average game that you have no real reason to play.",1

2015," Buy this game whatever the price tag as by the end you will understand why it's worth it, but prepare yourself to go on a serious journey.  Pros:    Simple, straight forward controls that anyone can use.  A story/narative that will leave you wondering who you really are.  Almost 2 solid hours of gameplay if you rush through and easily playable a second time. Cons:    Will make you cry and challenge if you really are okay.  You will be broke from now on paying for therapy to help yourself move on.  Davey (Buy, play and you'll understand).I would happily vote for this game to be game of the year. It challenged and affected me in a way I wasn't expecting it to. Don't read this unless you've played, really, don't. ~  I hope you and Coda find peace Davey. ",2

2015," Flawless game, what flawless game? nah but honestly this is an amazing game. You go around fighting robots cutting off stormtroopers arms and whatnot. I really love the way you can force grip someone and fling them across the map or guide them into other enemys.This might just be my computer but the sky goes all weird and reminds me of when you don't have the right addons for gmod and the sky reflects what you look at on the ground. Does that make sense?The plot is alright, Darth Vaders apprentice takes down the rest of the jedi's and teams up with Vader to plot against the Emperor. Or is Vader using his apprentice?",2

This game cost $80 WITHOUT dlc currently and I think it is a bit crazy considering there is no multiplayer or survival, anything like that.But that being said the story, immersion, graphics and first person shooter elements are all blended in perfectly together and make for a wonderful experience, although again I'm not sure the price is quite justified.For the game itself and not it's value for money I think the 96/100 metascore rating is well deserved and an immersive leap into the floating city of Columbia!",1

It's really good how you can travel to other planets and useful, because you might've took nearly all the ores out of the world, so you just go to a different planet! Also, it's scientific, like if you keep on heading up, eventually you will enter space and find a meteorite! The soundtracks are just amazing... There is also dungeons, Asteroid fields, villages and heaps of biomes. One of my favourite things about Starbound is the tech. Tech is you can say almost a power you acquire. There's heaps of them and I reckon bubble boost and butterfly boost is the best. So get Starbound right now and don't wait to get it! As I strongly recommend it. 😊",2

2015,"Your son is sick because you couldn't afford heat last night. Now he needs medicine and today isn't looking any better. Then a man shows up. Something seems off about him, but hey, all his paperwork's in order. Then you remember: He's a murderer fleeing the country of his crime. The same murderer you have orders to detain. You reach for the button but wait, he puts something on the table. 10 Credits. Heat for your family tonight. Money you desperately need. A man who deserves death. What do you do?Papers, Please will see you having to make many similar moral choices such as this one and having to decide what's important. A lady wants to visit her son for the first time in years but her Passport expired. A man bribed you to let someone in but they have faulty credentials. Oh and that Kolechian you let in? She was a suicide bomber and just killed 3 guards. Now there's going to be a security revamp tomorrow. ♥♥♥♥ that man's photo was fake. Guess that's a penalty on your ever dwindling budget.

2015,"If you loved Far Cry 3 for it's gameplay you'll love Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon. It's a short throwback to the 80s with a ton of references that may have flown over my head, but others will certainly love. Definitely worth buying in the bundle with Call Of Juarez Gunslinger. The story is ok at best but it's still a solid Far Cry experience and I can't wait for Far Cry 4 Blood Dragon",2
2015,"Recently, I purchased EDGE during the Steam Holiday/Christmas sale for $0.99! And let me tell you, that is the best dollar I have ever spent. The game requires strategy and can be very challening to the mind. Overall the music makes the player feel relaxed, giving a very laid back feeling. If you just want to play a simple plotted game (playing as a cube, collecting cubes whilst solving puzzles) that provides fun and has charm, or you want something that is fun yet challenging as the game progresses, then this is for you. Frame rate does not seem to be a problem and runs very smoothly.10/10",1
2015,"The sims 3 is a very enjoyable game... WIth the DLC... I mean the core game is fun for the first couple of hours or even the first couple of days but it dries out quickly.There isn't enough to do in the core game and if you want all the DLC you are going to need to pay approximately $400, I recommend getting the game right now during the flash sale or just when the game is on special so you can enjoy the game a little more.Game elements like playing the Piano and going to university should realy be in the core game but no, you are going to have to pay for the ""Late Night"" DLC if you want a piano, or the ""University Life"" DLC if you want your sim to go streaking. With the DLC the game is exceptional but it costs far too much money to play the game without getting bored.If you bought all the DLC for $400... You could have bought 50 if not more games for that value, cheap-ish ones of course but there are many impressive indie games out there, especially now that the summer sales are going round so you can get over 100 games and still have some change.But as we all know EA are notorious for DLC so asking for less DLC that is cheaper would be asking too much so only buy this game if you have seen gameplay of the core game and seem interested enough or if you want to play for DLC.",1
2015,"This game is very addictive and impressed me a lot the first time i played it, as I don't really like games with the camera angle that this game provides, it impressed me with the overall enjoyment of the combat, the multiplayer etc. I would recommend buying this game ESPECIALLY since its on sale for the summer sales!",1
2015,"Very enjoyable! I'm glad that this game is free cause ive been looking for a fun free game for a while... But thats beside the point, this game is very addictive and the guns are VERY customizable so almost every player has a different, uniquely customized gun that you can pick up and have a play with. The graphics are very polished and unique in a way, so i highly recommend getting this game.",1
2015,"Tenno unite in this epic rpg based in our solar system and the planets within. This free rpg is well worth the download as it offers hours of fun and gameplay with a minimal feel of p2w.There are missions that you can go in undetected and assassinate your enemies or you can go in with all guns blazing to liberate the solar system against the grineer, corpus and infested threat.There is even a foundry where you can build weapons, equipment, warframes and more that you find within missions or you can purchase them from the market with credits or buy the completed version with platinum including an orokin catalyst or orokin reactor.With daily real-time events and unique rewards that follow, you are always encouraged to pop in-game once and a while to check the events and even your daily login reward that vary from xp to void keys that challenge your skill in the void.Be sure to join the ""Warframe events"" group to get notified when an event is starting so you can join the fight!",1
2015,"Haunted Memories, a beautiful, slender spin-off, unfortunately not the best spin-off out there with the countles bugs experienced throughout playing the game.Thankfully I haven't experienced the teleportation bug where you teleport backwards continuously, but at times my character teleports to a random place in the immediate vicinity and says ""What the hell was that!?"" Whilst looking at a table for example... It's just a table, no need to ♥♥♥♥ yourself.Unfortunately this game has a habbit of glitching on objects and the terrain, after reading other reviews before playing I learnt that people died by jumping on barrels and such so I avoided that, but upon entering the upstairs area of the inn I slightly clipped a door frame which resulted in my character being paralyzed and ending in his untimely demise thanks to fall damage, dispite me not falling even a millimetre.After the dissapointment of my death I decided to start a new game on paranormal difficulty, and boy was I surprised. My character spawned holding the axe, the crowbar, the lantern, and flashlight and the gun and the book was also being held, I also had another pair of arms and hands, and I hadn't even picked anything up. None of the items were useable at that which resulted in a very buggy group of items on my screen, interested to see what else was broken I decided to approach the car to pick up the flashlight and the book, however my character was incapable of doing so, I approached the items and there was no interaction button even after spamming the ""e"" key, he picked nothing up. The game was also lagging immensley at this point as opposed to all the other difficulties (the lag was likely all the glitchy items). And in turn the game crashed.However the scares can be surprising so the horror aspect can still be found, however do not get this game if you dislike unfinished, frustrating, glitchy games.Update: after deciding to give this game an extra chance I played it for a couple of hours over the weekend and I was dissapointed :/ I encountered the teleportation bug that teleports me anywhere on the map randomly which was very frustrating and I was continuously dieing of fall damage when clipping an object. There are multiple glitchy textures thqat need seeing to also, what the develepers should focus on in the next update is not releasing up chapters but updating the existing chapters, I would play Chapter 2 but it doesn't detect that I own Haunted Memories so unfortunately I can't, but I've seen gameplay footage of it and there are also countless bugs and even spelling mistakes in the dialogue.Urgent Update is Needed",1
2015,"Fast paced, 2D, action, fighting game in which you click the left and right mouse button to attack or pick up weapons depending on which side of you are on, very addictive and very fun and would be great on other gaming platforms such as mobile devices and even on console.Pick it up whilst its hot!",1
2015,"This is a cheap, fun, addicting and stupid game that I would recommend for any gamer, casual or hardcore. I mean why wouldnt you want to play this game... You're a goat!There are lots of good features about this game including the goat trophy collectables, the unlockable mutations and especially the workshop! the game has multiple achievements that arent too hard to get which is always fun and there is always a reason to come back and play some more!Much baaa, many goat.wow.",1
2015,"Graphics look the same as on CS:S. Sound is the same. Gameplay is broken, the bullets go up (physics? who needs physics). Bots are the dumbest in the whole series. And than there is the greatest microtransactions ever. For only 300€ you can have a skin for a knife. How about you take that knife and shove it up your ♥♥♥.

Looking pretty good there OVK, just don't screw this up with the Safehouse customization or anything else.As of 15.10.2015 PAYDAY 2 has been renamed PAY2WINDAY 2 or P2W: The Game. I seriously loved this game, spent 2,000 hours on it, and now came the greed, the microtransactions. They ruined the game (well it was ruined before, however still good enough to play), you can call those microtransactions as The Final Nail In the Coffin of PAYDAY 2 and the Crimefest 2015 as PAYDAY 2's Funeral. Don't buy this game, it is no longer a good game. Score: -∞/∞.P.S. Microtransactions are the spawn of Satan, they are awful. I get the idea if this was a F2P game, still would ♥♥♥♥ me off, but the developer has to make some money off of it. But for a paid game: ♥♥♥♥ NO!!!!!P.P.S RIP PAYDAY 2, PAYDAY 2's modding community, PAYDAY 2 players.

The newest update added many more hours of gameplay. Once you start playing multiplayer, many more hours accumulate. There are a lot of entities in the game, and it is very difficult to keep track to them at first. Use the wiki available to find out about any part of the game, you'll find that the huge amount of weapons, blocks, mobs and boss challenges mean that the game can be played for hours on end, without crafting the same weapon or fighting a same boss twice.",1

2015,作為第一個在steam入手的遊戲，老實說當初是為了1.6來順便帶回來，由於當時網路不太穩的關係1.6打完就會打zero...這款我只能說，應該是Valve的黑歷史了吧，1.6的畫質與武器，更少的模式可以選擇，有劇情的CS？老實說都是在拆炸彈跟救人而已，上個禮拜重新安裝此遊戲，有一堆伺服器但是連個2-3隻小貓都沒有。不過本遊戲還是有個可取之處就是radio的語音是用中文，聽起來頗有新鮮感的。,1
2015,上古卷軸5承襲了上古系列的高自由度，不論玩家要當個救世英雄、著名公會的領導、或是臭名昭彰的刺客組織首領都可以，且不侷限在某單一類型的技能上。與4代相比，玩家在這裡即使是偏向正方或反方，都不太會對你的名聲有影響，大部分的居民即使是當地領主或是家族首腦，都是些孤陋寡聞的凡夫俗子（即使玩家已經是在世界裡面該是聲明遠播的大英雄），所以並不會太尊敬你，但也不會太鄙視你。而知道你的內幕的永遠都是帶著面罩，膝蓋曾經受傷的警衛大哥（大姐）。有很多玩家都是被這款有著豐富的MOD給吸引，但是上古系列的賣點除了高自由度以外還有他的故事性，但以玩過4代的感覺來說，5代的故事性與傳奇性仍是跟4代有著一段明顯的差距。另外本作的bug也有點多，雖說大部分應該都是MOD相衝所造成的...而若要體驗完整的上古卷軸5，請連同所有DLC一起買，因為後面的MOD都是有配合DLC的，沒有這些DLC能玩的MOD也非常有限。,1
2015,GTA SA是個高自由的開放世界遊戲，從PS2開始玩了之後就對這類遊戲沈迷，因為實在太好玩了！不論你當時心情好或不好，看到路人就稍微打到他昏倒來搶錢，或是吃了熊心豹子膽來開槍打警察，帶著火箭筒去轟炸敵對黑幫，甚至搶一台坦克或戰鬥機對城市發動恐怖攻擊，這實在太爽快啦！承襲GTA系列主角通常擁有犯罪史或家族的背景，本作劇情常常牽扯黑道，主角從當上一個黑幫老大在被陷害到偏鄉小鎮避難，最後獲得貴人幫助消滅叛徒，光是看劇情就是一個電影的節奏。本作已經10週年了，連Android系統都推出了本作，而Android系統上的GTA SA又是個畫質新突破。實在很希望R星也能重製這款遊戲，當然也要加入一些新要素，不要像S開頭跟C開頭的日本遊戲大廠只會原封不動的將家機遊戲移植到電腦上。,1
2015,世紀帝國2是從國小就接觸過的遊戲，控兵技術、起手、偵查，屯兵到最後帝國興起與征服敵人，世紀帝國2用很簡單但內容不簡單的特點來作到這些，因種族而異，有不同的兵種或是科技，當然也有不能使用的，因此展露出不同的戰術策略，你願意的話甚至連村民都是你的優秀戰力。世紀帝國系列另一個特色就是他有豐富的史實戰役，姑且不管真實性，在國小的時候多虧了他，當時我對歷史課的興趣又增加了不少，且遺忘王朝又新增了好幾個戰役且都有在持續更新，雖然遺忘王朝的電腦對手整體來說比起征服者的AI高出很多，戰役上沒有一定的控兵技術很快就會任務告吹或是被攻到家破人王，但是還是值得挑戰。另外他很好找到盜版，這是我對他一個很深的印象。不過即使後來再重買了正版，仍是聽不到他的音樂，這款遊戲讓我能夠真正聽到從遊戲播放的音樂。不過說真的，畫質等有所提昇，雖然是真的看出來，但頂多就是水面的畫質最明顯，其他的幾乎像是雞肋一般。,1

2015,"SHORT VERSION | The game is pretty great.-----------------------------------------------------------------------LONG   VERSION | Pros:+ Characters are quirky, almost too much so, but I love each and every one of them.+ Game is challenging enough on preferred dificulty; with good balance between complexity and simplicity.+ The Humour is sometimes cringey, but for the most part its good for a giggle or two.+ The art style is consistent, it may not be for you but it does maintain aesthetic consistency.Cons:- Quite grindy at later stages.- Hearing the same song for the same enemy can get repetive very quickly when doing said grinding.- UI is console driven, and can be clunky at times for PC and keyboard.- Limited options if you're not ok with that sort of thing.The experience has been overall positive with this game, if you're not terribly into rythmn games or RPGs then one of the two genres might drag you through this game with some minor gripes, but for the most part even if you're not terribly into either it is worth it for the characters and the story.7/10",1

The sharks are amazing, the look of them, the movements amazing. The game is lots of fun, intense, heart pounding, you actually fear for your life once the music starts haha, and I'm so excited to be apart of it.  For game at this stage it is amazing. Definitely a game everyone should get their hands on. survival mode absolutely amazing sharks literally keep you on your toes, but pvp (sharks and divers), and the heart pounding intensity goes to a whole new level.All in all, a game for everyone, definitely a must, and definitely a game to keep and eye on. 10/10",1

2018,I recommend Adventure Capitalist who want to try how capitalism works. It's like that you collect as much money as possible while you're still away. It's a great simulator and I hope in the future that there are more features in this game.10/10 and 5 Stars for this one. Simply Fantastic.,2

2015,"Firstly, this game is Ok. You know the problem? In this game, the mechs are overpriced. They cost like 12k credits. each round i only get bout 120credits. Seriously, are the devs trying to get people to spend real money or what. its like literally a pay to win for the good robots.(U still need skills though). I really hope the devs can either lower the price or make some readjustments.Secondly, this game doesnt let you try out mechs you want. You have to wait till the mechs are on trial. And there are tens of mechs in this game. So what do they expect you to do if u buy a mech but dont like it. They expect you to GRIND AND GRIND again. And worse still you cant sell mechs.Still fun though. Just make sure you find your playstyle and TRY NOT TO BUY THE WRONG MECH LIKE ME*supois internally*",1
2015,"Amazing game, simple but amazing, lots of different items, guns, and miscs. When I first saw this game I thought that it was just one of those crappy indie ones but when I started playing it, I got so hooked that I never stopped playing it. What really makes me impressed in the game is how only one person developed it (Nelson), the stealth system, and the various guns that you can acquire throughout the map. This game is still early access but it feels like it's already a finished product because of it having few glitches (which are very rare to encounter). Please play this game and maybe give a little support to Nelson for all the work he's done just to make this game possible, I guarantee you that you won't be dissapointed. :)",1

2015,i went into this game with an open mind. i thought... it would not move me...But wow what a powerfull message! For someone to share there deepest feelings with anyone...Take the time to go though this.It will blow you away.,1
2015,"An amazing game, for all those that enjoy 2D side scrolling games along with crafting and fighting monsters to survive, this game thrives to keep the player ocupied with learning how to craft certain items and abiltitys (like minecraft). Along with choosing your class by picking your abilitys like magic, melee and ranged attacks in which you get the new choice of an ability every 5 levels, I recomend this game to any one that loves minecraft, side scrolling games and challenging enemys which will put you to the limits!",1
2015,I have two words of advice for you almir:FFFFUUUUUUCKKKKKKK YYOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU,1

2015,I find the lack of racing with arms disturbing.,0
2015,I met up with a group of friends. It took about 2 hours to finally catch up with da bois and what we do to celebrate. We used the suicide emote and i shoot myself. One of the other group members shot the rest and killed himself10/10 would kill myself again,0
2015,Being good is so boring.,0
2015,"This game. THIS GAME. You will learn to love it, hate it, despise it and cry over it. Deaths are far too quick to notice where you got shot from. Artillery bombardments make you shake in fear, quiver and panic as you rush frantically to any sort of cover with a roof above your head, only to be blown up mere meters away from safety. Kills are satisfying, requiring patience as a rifleman to ply some of the most awesome kills from afar at unprecedented angles imagined. Have you ever wondered what it's like to shoot at a german stahlhelm slightly sticking out from a trench at over 200 meters from between a broken car's windows? In Red Orchestra 2, you can. When you first start, the game is brutally punishing to you. As a new player, you will die. Treat it like you would treat a boss fight in Dark Souls 2- each death is a learning experience. Soon instead of rushing into a point to secure it, you'll learn to take things slow and have a cautious approach to everything. Cover is essential, but never use the broken cover system. Kills will be far and few in between unless the enemy charges straight on. After putting a few hours into the game, you'll suddenly realize two things: 1. Suddenly, you don't want to be the first to dash between cover. 2. Your aim is steadier under fire. The progression level gives you minimal bonuses that gets better and better the more you play a certain class. For new comers, it is advisable to play as the rifleman class, the most versatile (IMO) class you can choose while not having as much of an impact on a team's potential victory. Get used to bolt action rifles, because those are the most common weapons, but also your most trusthworthy firearm. Of course, the game isn't perfect: Game crashes in between map transitions (for me, at least but I have met a few people suffering from the same issues.) makes for infuriating campaign runs, and rejoining is a pain. Some minor glitches of course (My favourite perhaps was not being able to aim through my M1890 Mosin-Nagant Scope Rifle after dropping from the first floor of a building.) but nothing that detracts from an overall enjoyable (In a slightly masochistic manner) gameplay experience. Well, nothing that can't be solved with a grenade and a suicide.",1
2015,"Ever get bored of promised graphic updates only to be disappointed? Fret not, for Pendragon Rising (And other games from Choice of Games) lets you use your imagination to power their stories. Pendragon Rising is a well written story that urges the reader to quickly come to grasp with the lore of the world, which there is quite a bit to learn on every playthrough. The romance system in the story isn't at all what you've seen in other CoG games, but personally I find it refreshing and a tad bit more relatable. My only complain about the game is how short it can be- it took me roughly 2.5 hours to finish it in my first run, shorter if I hadn't restarted it twice. But it does have high replayability if you're willing to read through some of the other mandatory texts. ",1
2015,One of the best games ever!!,1
2015,♥♥♥♥!!!,1
2015,Can't save my game progress due to Games For Windows Live being a broken buggy piece of carp.The GFWL service doesn't work with my Windows 7 configuration.Can't even play the game without having to enable the Windows Update service.Waste of money - GFWL DRM is even worse than Ubisoft's UPlay.,0
2015,"Diablo 2.9 +10 of original awesomeness and an AOE of 3.6 ♥♥♥-kicking baddestness per enemy per second. Flawless mechanics, skills, itemisation. This is A-RPG done right. Download and share it around, game-folder can be copy-pasted, accounts are Free. Runs on old intel integrated chips (Intel GMA4500 MHD - laptop) quite well. It's the 9th Most Played Game on Steam at the moment ... why? Because +5 Awesomeness of dynamic content-placement algorithms make your bearded Templar's improved silicon nipples into seamless distributors of loot-dropping gnarliness, that's why!",0

2015,"If your a superhero fan, especially if your a Batman fan or even you just like games in general, Batman Arkham Knight is amazing!* It has superb graphics.* It's easter eggs are everywhere yet very clever.* Story is deep and complex.* Gameplay is responsive and fluid.If you dont want a chance to have an occasional frustrating experience on this game do not think of purchasing this until the bugs such as 30fps cap and some texture popping (etc.) are fixed for sure.Also, if you don't already know and are not buying it at all on PC because of the mixed reveiws on Steam, there is nothing wrong with the game itself! The reasoning for these negetive reveiws are for the bugs!The game as you probably know is being suspended from being soled on PC for a bit till Rocksteady fix it up, as the PC port was done by a third party company.You can change the fps lock by changing the ini files.If you do I recommend you back up your game first so it doesn't screw up.Over all this game is awesome and is most likely the best Arkham game in the franchise!",1

2015,Il miglior SandBox mai giocatoCi ho dedicato ore e ore a questo gioco e devo dire che la community e enormeQuesto gioco non e paragonabile a nessun gioco.Puoi fare tutto quello che ti pare e piace nessun limite.L'online ha mille modalità e in continuo sviluppo.Mod strepitose e infinite.L'unica pecca è che se cominci a scaricare troppe addons crasha il gioco :/ quindi non consiglio di scaricarglio troppe addon se no poi vi finirà come a me.Garry's Mod che era una mod e arrivato al tal punto a diventare un vero e propio gioco.CONSIGLIO L'ACQUISTO:Quando CI SONO I SALDI,1
2015,"Arrivo con il dire che Tropico 3 e veramente un bellissimo gioco.Veramente ben strutturato per essere ambientato In un isola tropicale durante il periodo della guerra fredda in cui vi troverete voi stessi ad amministrare il vostro stesso stato.Come gioco e molto simile a SimsCity ma Tropico e molto meglio di SimCity (A parere mio).Fantastico vedere anche cosa pensa il propio popolo di voi dalle proteste pacifiche alle rivolte dai propi cittadini.Sinceramente per un 1,79 $ ne è valsa la pena comprarlo vale per me anche il prezzo intero.Cabaret,Cinema,Stadio,ecc,,,,,,, devo dire che e un ottimo simulatore.La grafica e discreta non una delle migliori ma  man mano che giocherete non riuscirete a scollarvi dal vostro pc.E poi il gioco è abbastanza semplice diventerà difficile quando non riuscirete a far felice la vostra popolazione e scoppieranno rivolte anche da parte dei militari in cui si ribelleranno se non ascolterete le loro richieste e non le soddisferete.Il vostro consigliere sarà un emerito servo ma vi sarà utilissimo a evitare rivolte e carestie Tropico 3 e riuscito a guadagnarsi sia i miei soldi e ad entrare nella categoria dei miei giochi preferiti !Voto:9.5/10Suggerimenti:Compratelo o quando è in offerta",1
2015,"Counter Strike uno dei miei primi giochi per pc.Da una semplice mod a un gioco di fama mondiale.Counter Strike è uno dei titoli più belli a cui abbia giocato peccato per l'assenza della campagna ma come rimedio c'è Counter Strike Condition Zero Deleted Scene.Counter Strike Global Offensive è un degno sequel di Counter Strike Source in cui si dimostra con una grafica molto meglio di Counter Strike Source.Il mutiplayer e veramente ben strutturato e fatto bene.Continuando ci sono sempre le due solite fazioni ""Anti-Terroristi"" e ""Terroristi"".Una delle mappe più celebri di Counter Strike è De_Dust2 una delle prime mappe sbucate nella mod di Counter Strike ed è ambientata in Israle.Counter Strike è ormai uno dei giochi più amati in tutto il mondo per il suo Multiplayer semplice e divertente in cui gli ""AT"" e i ""T"" si ammazzano fra di loro nelle varie modalità.Bè Valve ha fatto un ottimo lavoro come sempre ha fatto non deludendo mai nessuno dei loro fan.Voto:7.5/10",1
2015,AirBuccaneers è un gioco fantastico ! Ammetto che ci ho giocato un ora ma il gioco e favoloso sopratutto i combattimenti via aerea.La personalizazzione dei personaggi e simile a quella degli uomini primitivi.La maggior parte delle navi è fatta con ossa di animali.Sopratutto la nave è formata da uno scheletro di balena è dietro dell'timone della nave si può trovare la bocca di uno squalo :D.Ambientazzioni fantastiche simili a quelle di Star Wars.L'unica cosa brutta sono i combattimenti corpo a corpo :/.Voto: 6/10,1
2015,"Veramente peccato per Infestation Survivor Stories un gioco con un alto potenziale ma sviluppato veramente male.Cominciamo  col dire che Iss sarebbe potuto essere un buon gioco ma dai continui Bug,Glitch e la mancanza di aggiornamenti per sistemare questi problemi il gioco si è rivelato un vero e propio disastro.Le animazioni sono tremende ed è pay-to-win.Il gioco e disseminato da banditi shopponi con equipaggiamento tutto comprato con soldi veri.Gli zombie ti inseguono fino a costennarti e in un posto mica ci sono 3 o 4 zombie sparsi in giro NO! C'è mezza città e ogni volta morirete.Le armi rarissime ma sono carine.Il gioco e talmente pesante che lagga sul mio pc e inoltre il mio pc riesce a sostenere DayZ perfettamente.Questo gioco avrebbe meritato di meglio ma i produttori se ne stanno sbattendo.E pagare per comprarsi i personaggi ? State scherzando spero.Lo sconsiglio veramente almeno che i produttori si decidano a sistemare questo gioco e a farlo perfetto e come si deve.Ma sicuramente meglio di TakedownVoto:5.5/10Consiglio Acquisto:Non compratelo finché non faranno una patch che sistemi tutti i bug e tutti i problemi del gioco sopratutto il lag in quantita",1
2015,"Bellissimo Tower Defence uno dei migliori giochi che abbia giocato mi aspettavo poco da questo gioco sopratutto che l'ho preso su ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" invece mi sbagliavo di GROSSO bellissimo grafica non molto pesante gioco altamente difficile.Carina anche la grafica non una delle migliori.Le armi non dico che siano identiche ad ""Halo"" ma la somiglianza c'è.Bello anche durante il caricamento che si vedono le vignette dei personaggi dell'gioco.Questo gioco e uno dei migliori giochi di strategia.Sopratutto certe volte rimarrete voi soli e le vostre torrette a combattere contro gli alieni visto che i vostri compagni (Bot) sono stati uccisi dagli alieni quindi aumente la difficoltà essendo soli con le vostre torrette.Ambientazioni bellissime non vi stancherete mai di questo gioco le bestemmie sicuramente partiranno quando morirete e il nucleo verrà distrutto.Consigliato vivamente!Voto:7/10 Per eventuali errori grammaticali scusatemi !",1
2015,"Veramente peccato per la chiusura di THQ.Saint Row è uno dei giochi più belli,folli,divertenti,ed esileranti che abbia mai giocato.Saint Row racconta la storia di un gruppo di gangster di fama mondiale che controlla ormai tutta Steelport.Voi sarete il capo di una di queste gang I Saints.In cui vi scontrerete con moltissime gang i Morningstars,Deckers,Stag (Militari),Luchadores.Il gioco è uno dei più divertenti che io abbia mai giocato dalle battute esileranti alle varie modalita che sono veramente assai.Gli upgrade delle armi sono fighissime.E poi c'è il penetrator* va be ci siamo capiti.... .Bè Saint Row ad ogni modo e un degnissimo sequel del secondo,Voto:8.5/10Consiglio Acquisto:Prendetelo al massimo 5 euro io lo ho preso 1 euro con altri giochi su Humble Bundle",1
2015,"Un gioco orribile più di Takedown MAI VISTO !.Gioco che gioca su Unreal Engine ed e ha la grafica pesante.Surriscalda in 3 minuti peggio di minecraft sopratutto io che ho un pc che ci sta una vita a surriscaldarsi.Gioco pianificato male.Npc deficenti,basta un colpo da parte dell'nemico e crepate come una massa di coglioni.Quando voi cercherete di prendere la mira ""Episodio capitato a me"" il vostro alleato si metterà davanti e si farà ammazzare.Quando impugnate la pistola sembra che il vostro personaggio abbia le mani deformate.Quando cambierete classi ai seguenti personaggi non si applicheranno ma si applicheranno quando riavvierete il gioco.QUESTO GIOCO E UNO SCHIFO ALTAMENTE SCONSIGLIATO NON BUTTATE I VOSTRI SOLDI IN QUESTO GIOCO SEMBRA BELLO DALLE IMMAGINI MA E UNA PORCATA PRENDETEVI SANCTUM 2 CHE E MOLTO MEGLIO Voto:1/10",1

2015,"This is my most played game on steam, most of the community is awesome, and it is great to see this game finally getting the attention it deserves, there are so many unique game modes to discover, adn if you are into the classic sandbox gamemode , there is still tons of support, as in models, maps, items being made for it. All running on the reliable source engine which is still holding its ground almost 10 years later.",1
2015,"I bought this game almost a year ago and I will now show my thoughts and feelings towards this game. I never played 1.6, but I played something like 48 hours of CSS. The beauty of the game is how much more simpler and to the point it is, no kill streaks you have to constantly worry about being destroyed by, and no perks which can make games very uneven. Everything is just available to you as soon as you download it. The only purchasable items give you no advantage, and are simply just cosmetic items which some people will go in great lengths to collect, gathering an inventory of up $10k+. I played the casual game mode for the first 24 hours of the game, and then finally hopped in  matchmaking, where you are given a rank after 10 games. You only get matched up with people around the same skill level as you which is great, unlike other games where you get destroyed until you manage to gather enough skill to fight back.There are some hackers in this game who try to hide that, but often they eventually get banned by VAC or Overwatch, which is a thing in the game which gives experienced players the chance to watch games where players think ""The Suspect"" Was hacking, to which they then choose a verdict.The game is good for veterans and newbies alike, as gun play and movement has since been changed since older titles. Overall the game is a must buy for anyone into competitive first person shooters, and the great thing being that I have earned the $15 back just from getting and selling items that randomly dropped in game for me. Its wonderful.10/10 Without some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1 line joke review",1

2015,这款游戏是电视剧权利的游戏迷必入啊，可以接触到很多电视剧里的角色，而且还是原句配音，想想都带感！游戏的方式嘛，自由度基本体现在对话选择上，，本身是没啥自由度的，基本跟着剧情走。画面配乐很多也都是剧里面的。总而言之，美剧粉丝买买买，不太了解权利的游戏的玩家不是特别推荐,1
2015,玩了小半个赛季，简单说下，个人感觉如果是50刀买的话。。不划算，不值这个钱，有耐心的还是等打折入吧说这个话，不是说这代不好玩，而是16继承了FM系列一直以来的尿性。。更新真心少唯一值得说的就是设置战术的时候确实更直观了，但是东西还是那些东西， 记者会还是那几句词。。从CM03/04一路走过来，不知道为什么到这代突然有点审美疲劳了。。,1

2015,"A fun lighthearted game. Reminded me of the old DukeNukem style of game. I was stuck in the first mission thinking if I killed everything they would stop coming and that I would just walk to the objective. Wrong! I am in two minds whether this is a good or bad thing as you get rated at the end of the mission how many kills, how many secrets and how long you take. Well you can keep killing guys and take forever and get a crap score or you can run to the objective not worrying to much about the aliens and get a decent score. Not quite balance in that regard. An ejoyable game. If you can grab for under $5 its a great deal.6.5/10",1
2015,Great game! Love the story and the ability to make some decisions that have long term effects. I was able to enjoy the game even though it lacked the latest graphics which is a big deal for me. 8.5/10,1
2015,Awesome game. I haven't enjoyed a game like this in a long time. Look the story is 1/10 the graphics are 6/10 but the gameplay is 10/10Overall 8/10,1
2015,Great game if you like the MMORPG genre. Excellent graphics (you need a decent pc to appreciate this) the talent tree allows you to actually customise your character to how you like to play! Really enjoyed the game from 1-60. Nice little secrets tucked away in hard to get spots. Generally I just  PVP'd till 60 (max level) and dominated but at 60 they have a pvp grind like no other to get the best gear. So my mate and I quit shortly after hitting 60. 8/10,1
2015,Really enjoying this car racing game. Awesome graphics and the car handling feels good. Try the demo and get it on sale if you can :)8.5/10,1
2015,Just started playing this game. I am finding it refreshing. A game to relax and explore.,1
2015,"I am really enjoying Dying Light. The environment is excellent and the player progression feels right. If you like the Far Cry type of game and Zombies this is for you, I am yet to play co op mode which apparently where the game shines. I do feel the combat is a bit sloppy, hit and miss but the game is still enjoyable.8 Zombies out of 10",1
2015,Very fun game to play with friends but easy to rage quit. I might recommend playing on a pvp or 1000x server to get the hang of it first. The mele needs to be better but otherwise very good game. (still in beta),2

2015,"My God...I LOVE THIS GAME, and this is created by one person, man i salute you, this game is amazing, i dont know how many times, i have to say it, play singleplayer, awesome, but it does have an end, multiplayer, infinty, this game has SOO much potential, i hope this game goes far, cos i love everything about it, the only complaint i have, is maybe add a way to get to a bigger land, with more guns, more vechicle, and add some objectives, you know some goal, so you have something to work twoards on the side along with surviving, because so far it does get a bit boring to the end, when you practically have a fort of a base, but otherwise, this game is worth every penny, i even got gold, to give the guy some more money to work on this game, good on ya",1

2015,Hilarious game i could play it forever,1
2015,"Weapon balance is terrible, tripwire need to fix that. It feels like op weapons for demolitionist for example such as the rpg are underpowered and useless. The game is a lot harder then the original killing floor, I think Tripwire need to dile down the difficulty a little bit. I often find that with normal clots they are running at the speed of gorefasts which shouldn't be happening, please fix that tripwire. Not just with the clot but every zed. I like how tripwire made it so you could achive up to level 25 for each perk, it is a great way to make sure the player always is occupied and always has something to do rather then spend a tonne of time completing crazy challenges to level up your perks in the original killing floor. The weapons i feel are too expensive. I often have to wait until wave 4 to actually purchase the weapon that I want because my dosh is going up so slowly and by the time I actually purchase the weapon I want, if I'm playing a short game I'm already at the boss round and didn't get a chance to use it much. Please make the weapons cheaper. I also like how tripwire keeps adding new maps such as black forest and farmhouse, and a new perk gunslinger is very interesting and I would definately recoomend trying it. The return of the patriarch is also a fantastic thing, something killing floor fans will be very excited about. Overall it still incorperates the satisfying killing floor feeling of just simply killing and is a good game however I do feel like these problems I mentioned should be fixed.",1

It's just great, i've been robbed twice and shot onsite for wandering into Cherno and uttering the word ""friendly"" My only complaint/Suggestion would be that you fix those Noclipping zombies ASAP. as it ruins a lot of play at the moment.

2015,"Amazing Nordic-themed artwork and music. Tougher bosses than I originally imagined, which made it far more refreshing, nearly as if Dark Souls had been incorporated into a kid's Viking adventure gane. On the whole it's a great game, but the combat style could be a turn-off for those who aren't willing to use one battleaxe and one fighting mechanic the entire game.Definitely would recommend. The price tag attached to the game is rather reasonable for a game that would probably last 4 to 6 hours depending on your playstyle. If you love Norse lore, this game is for you.",1

2015,"I would really LOVE to play this game. The character customizeation proves to help you make a unique character and vehicle.But there some downsides in which i should mention...1. No sign of australian servers. Im from Sydney, so that means playing on a US server is like playing with alot of viruses in your pc. and i mean ALOT.2. AIs. Yes, the AIs are ♥♥♥♥, like. Very Very ♥♥♥♥. But really, the fun youll be getting out of this is the players. Which is another problem.3. Players. There really isn't alot of people on the servers, Exept for like, one US server. The rest of the servers are ♥♥♥♥ing empty nearly, i saw a server with 4 people on. Get this is mind, one server PER country, no, one server IN US AND BRAZIL.4. P2W. Or Pay to Win. Lets get this straight. I, ♥♥♥♥ing, Hate, pay to win games. Sure, it can be fun to play f2p games, but when it comes to that point when you keep getting killed by the same noob who bought a shotgun for 10 dollars. Its just not fair. I have no problem with pay to win games like planetside 2, because the stock weapons are newbie-friendly. But the stock weapons on APB reloaded is just, No...5. Car mechanics. Oh god where do i begin? You know those frustrating Ice physics you see in games? Its sort of like that. but this time, you driving a car on an ice-skating rink painted black and white with a bit of yellow. Its that bad, like REALLY bad. IDk if its just ther server problems i mentioned earlier or just a bug the developers cant be ♥♥♥♥ed fixing.Overall, these are just badsides, the customizeations is something deffinately worth playing this game for.i'd say 5/10. If you have spare time, give this game a ride.",1

2015,"I never really heard of it and boy i should have.my friends reccomended it when we were looking for a co-operative shooter to play.My god, i love this game.Heres the scenario: You've been stranded on a zombie-infested island and your goal is to survive, pretty simple at first until you relize everything is very limited. Your first gun might have 2 bullets in the clip. This makes finding melee weapons like axes or sledgehammers very lucky. The community varies, once your with a group of friendly people and the next thing your surrounded by bandits and taken hostage.This game looked really simple on the outside but when you play a rough hour of it you will start to notice how immersive the game can feel.There will also be scenarios where you have to make a hard decision. The game does not script that, this will happen in any way possible, will you go to the town and look for supplies? will you abbandonn your friend to the zombies and make an escape? will you eat the moldy corn and risk infection?The choice is yours and it can and will impact on what happens after.However, the game does have some downsides, which might not be a big problemThe shadows and details can sometimes screw my pc around, esspecialy if you have skype on.Sometimes the game can break by not spawning items properly, like once the only things i could find in a town is moldy corn and clips. I restarted the game and everything was fine, there were clothes, notes, bows, and everything else you might find in a post-apocalyptic town.The respawn time does not exsist in this game, once you die you can quickly sprint back into the game and hope for something different to happen.Out of all games i had not found such a zombie survival like this one aside from DayZ of course9.5/10",1

2015,"Massive world to explore, Nice fighting scenes amd all the crazyness you would exp[ect from Mad Max. Suprised to see the cars are RH drive nice work guys keeping it to the movie :) Definatly a great game and i can see myself replaying the whole campaign once i have completed it.

Pros: Lots of things to do
Punch on scenes and fighting tactics
personalaties of characters
open world feel
weapons and enhancements
looks amazing

Cons:
None really only that there is no MP or Coop (Coop would be wonderfull to have factions etc)
The car revs wild everytime you get into it, considering Fuel is a valuable resource that does not make sence. not mention it is anoying after a while.

Must have game in your collection.. And if they would allow modding tools so people can make there own coop mp that would be a bonus..",1

2015,"Having played Insurgency many years ago as a Source mod (back in 2007!!!), I was curious to see if it had evolved to the point of being a game worth buying in it's own right - and I wasn't let down.Insurgency plays as a cross between the arcadey, high action flow of Counterstrike and the unforgiving brutality Red Orchestra 2. You essentially are given varying objectives to accomplish and  a modest set of weapon and loadout options to choose from - which is handy, because if you are bad at FPS games you will be using the majority of your time in spectator, playing around with it. Bullets from high-powered rifles tend to one-hit-kill you if they manage to bypass whatever kevlar you have equipped and you will feel very, very vulnerable when moving between buildings.Playing this game is the first time in a while I've actually been grinning playing an FPS for many, many years. The lethality of the firearms makes moving from point to point tense, your decisions matter and your reaction times are crucial.Notably, it doesn't suffer the superfluous unlocking and premium mechanics of the Battlefields of the day, your killstreaks don't earn you an attack-dog airstrike, which brings me to my next point:Everyone, EVERYONE is on an even keel, and it's all down to how well you play. Or how badly you play, as when you die you will be spectating your comrades playing and teasing the ♥♥♥♥ out of them in group chat, or using the spare time to tweak your loadout to better match the pace of the combat.I'm happy to say that this is well worth the small price - buy the four-pack, give them to your buddies and pretend it's 2002 at a Counterstrike LAN.EDIT: Almost forgot. It has COOP play too!8/10+ Solid, no frills FPS action+ Brutal combat, tense and frantic gameplay+ COOP reminds me of Vietcong 2, good fun- Source graphics nothing to write home about (but who cares)- Do not get this if dying frustrates you",1
2015,This game is a true successor to PleasingFungus' flash game Manufactoria. It has all the pleasing problem solving of Zachtronic's previous big success SpaceChem with the delightfully accessible cubic layout Minecraft has etched into the current young generation.I can see this as a fantastic gateway into Engineering Studies for highschool kids as it challenges them to consider timing and design for manufacture.Absolutely recommend this game to anyone with a keen mind for solving problems.PS: game absolutely has a sense of humor!,1
2015,"The game is currently lacking in an endgame, which is generally expected from early access.Drag + drop mechanics for cooking, water purification etc is very clunky at best, magnetic/sticky points in fireplaces might help this issue.Injuries can sometimes mean a long and painful end to the game as medical supplies are nearly impossible to find whilst injured. Losing your oar or lighter is also a quick way to a painful death, as replacements are uncommon and there is no craftable option.This game has some promise, but larger islands and some mechanics fine-tuning are required to make it enjoyable past the first few hours.I recommend holding off on purchase of this game until the developers have fleshed out the game a bit more. $20 is  quite steep for what is available in the early release at this stage.",1
2015,"I came into this game with high hopes; expecting something akin to Red Orchestra on the scale of WW2 Online, I was pumped!What I instead found was an arcadey game of bunny-hopping germans that could be used as a literal definition for ""pay to win""; all bought guns are straight upgrades and there is no standard way to engage hostile armour without playing 10-20 matches, meaning sometimes you will come up against a team with top gear and you have no way to counter. The monetisation is constantly in your face, asking for around $10-$20USD per critical unlock; it's madness!Pros: - Almost a homage to WW2: OnlineCons:- Graphics look over a decade old- Character animation and control is abysmal- Horrendous monetisation- Controls are awful (transitioning stance, bunny hopping etc)Do NOT play this game.",1

Lovely game, beautiful, rugged landscapes and the deadliest enemy is the freezing winter.+ Atmosphere+ Ruthless (starting a game during a blizzard at 7pm)- Would like story content- No way to plot a map in-game, have yet to see a compass or watch as an item (maybe the geomagnetic storm would render it useless?)4.5/5",1
2015,One of the best deathmatch games of all time!,1
2015,"This is a great game and I love the minimalistic and modern style. But, the game is very short (I completed it in seven hours of gameplay).",1
2015,"Great game, cars, rockets, and a ball, what could go wrong?",1
2015,THE best racing game,1
2015,"Fabulous game, excellent port, well worth the wait.",1
2015,Nothing will ever beat the original Frag and Dash of Unreal Tournmanent.,2
2015,I paid $10 for this game and have played over 100 hours on it.  10c an hour... way better value than the amount I paid for BF2:BC and played sooo soooooooooo much less!,2
2015,The best of the Total War Series.  If you are used to playing resource based RTS then this series of games will be a bit of a shock to you.  It's more about placement of your units and knowing what counters what and making sure you don't get flanked.  A lot more strategic than get the resources and zerg their base!,2
2015,This is $3.33 today!  That's half evil!  3:D  Satan says to BUY THIS!,2
2015,"Really great game, easy to learn and with a bit of effort you will get some very satisfying wins!Totally recommend this game, get it while it's cheap!",2
2015,"It took me a while to warm to it, but eventually I left the original Company of Heroes behind.The automatch feature works, and the new expansion with the Americans and Oberwest Germans seems to have added a few new dimensions.It's normal price of $50 is reasonable.  I remember when I used to pay $100 for games.  If you can get it for $25 it's a damn good buy.",2
2015,"I bought this a couple of weeks back when it was on sale for about $20.I got really into it, taking Bristol City up into the Premier Division, then got head hunted by Newcastle but it wasn't long before I jumped their relegation bound ship to Leicester City.  Took them up to the top of the ladder, played in the Euro Cup, won the FA cup, had a few good seasons.Got a bit bored and pressed a few too many buttons of management and had an emergency meeting because I leaked some stuff to the press.  They asked me why they shouldn't fire me.  I responded - You won't find anyone better than me.  They disagreed and I was sacked!I had a few weeks holidays, only applying for top teams (Olympic Lyon, Valencia, Bayern) and finally landed the dream job of Manager of Real Madrid.Of course, the team were already performing well and so I made some slight tweaks and went on three months holiday.  Came back and saw they were still coming 4th, so went for another 3 month holiday.  Still 4th, but I was expected to win the LIGA so I played through the important games to make it happen.This game has a lot to it, but it can be slow and sucks up a ton of your time.  I got to the point of just going on holiday every match day so I could just quickly get a result.  I was in 2023 and everything just got boring so I resigned.Still tho, 162 hours (probably 30 of those spent AFK) for less than $20.  Good value.  But I do feel like I've wasted my life!  Hopefully I don't do something stupid like start a new career!",2
2015,Fantastic Game!+ Great Multiplayer + Great Team-Based+ Great Gunplay+ Great Graphics+ Great GameHighly Recommend 9/10,2

2015,"Suddenly i am taken back to my youth, hunched over an old arcade console spewing 20c coins into the machine to keep my dream alive.This game is a must for any old school racer who needs a nostalgia injection administered by a guy on a bike weilding a baseball bat, Gameplay is nice. smooth, still some work to be done with the AI i believe.Most importantly the Dev who is working on this release is actively patching and updating daily, i have already spoken to him in regards to some of the game mechanics and my input was welcomed and appreciated.I am yet to try co-op or multiplayer as none of my friends own this release yet, but i have no doubt it will be smooth, and any issues that are found will be fixed promptlyGiving this game 8/10, for an indie release especially, this game is fantastic.",1

2015,"+This game looks amazing for a 2004 release.+Story wasn't fantastic as far as I made it, but I was looking forward to it, nonetheless-Buggy ladders-Buggy stairs-AI can spot you from a mile away (edit:  they can spot you from unreasonably far away, and many times were spotting me from behind tents and such)-Missing textures (probably from a bad patch, don't know, honestly don't care anymore)-It refuses to even start on the highest graphic settings-I have to crash the game to get out of itBUT HEYI tried.  I really tried SO hard to love this game.It's simply not fun.  I made it almost half way without cheats.And even the devmode cheats couldn't get me through.I will not finish this game.Would be great if the AI weren't gods among men (and I'm on the easiest setting)edit:  AMD FX 8350, single R9 270x, 16GB ram, 7200RPM HDs",1
2015,"Does anyone else notice the ""fuuuu"" meme face when secondary-firing the REX launcher?  ahhahaCombining FPS/tower-defense in a game was a fantastic idea.  The game is great, but it's best with full 4P multiplayer.Strategy will come into play on harder levels, since you have a limited about of weapons to carry and type-of-units to be able to build, but when things get intense, the result can be very rewarding.",1
2015,"Great game!  (One of the very few fighting games I personally like)Devs are great about updating and keeping things well balanced.However, the DLC prices (extra characters for $5 a piece) are flatout robbery.",1

2015,"Excellent for a F2P (assuming you already own a game running on the source-engine)The maps are dark, gloomy and scary at points, if you're on your ownRight now, no guns seem massively-OP, meaning a more balanced game.The game is made tricky by how hindered you are when you run out of stamina (from sprinting/jumping etc.) But overall, the movement is fairly slow, so as you can't just rush through levels.",1
2015,"Pros-Beautiful graphics-Large map-Really fun with friends or just other players-Difficult but fun and rewarding gameplay-Regular updates-Good building and resource mechanics-Good crafting systemCons-Horrible memory leak, my Fps starts at about 90 when I first start playing and after a few hours I can start going as low as 20 FPS-Can sometimes have trouble joining Co-op games-Annoying glitches, bonfires become unlightable-Hard to remove buildings after they've been constructed-Hard to lineup and make level and square buildings with custom foundations, floor, walls, etc-Hackers will often join your games and spawn hundreds of logs or other items, as there is no VAC and/or 3rd party anticheat-Some caves are nearly empty and feature no loot other than food",1
2015,"Pros-Fun combat-Different clasees and weapons can completely change the playstyle-Wide variety of period weapons, including: Generic swords (short sword, broad sword, etc), Spear, Claymore, Billhook, Zweihander, Axes, Maces, Morning star.-Sharp learning curve-Easy to grasp, but hard to master combat-Nice maps and graphics-Plenty of blood and gore, including decapitations-Servers that only new players (<level 15) can join to learn the game before joining regular servers with more skilled players-Objective modes are fun and challenging, Push the cart, Destroy X, Kill the King, etc-You have a warcry button to scream while charging into battle-Polished game-Cheap on sale, 2.49 USDCons-Some weapons need minor changes to balance them",1
2015,"Dirty Bomb is a class-based arena (style) shooter.In Dirty Bomb one team must either destroy an objective, repair an objective, or move an objective from point A to B; where the other team will try to stop it.All Mercs (characters) have different types of equipment: some can heal, drop ammo packs, call in airstrikes, etc.Loadouts are cards, you receive cards from either getting them dropped at the end of a game, or buying them for 1,000 ingame credits (about 2 matches worth of credits). Cards have different rarities, the rarer, the more perks you have.Higher rarity also changes the cosmetics of your character, ie: different camo on clothing and weapons.Cards can be traded up for several cards of the same rarity plus a small amount of credits.Each character has 3 different primary and secondary and knives which you might get.Each character has different roles because of their weapons and equipment, and a different card (loadout) may change your playstyle because of the weapons or perks, etc.There are 2 mercs which are permanently unlocked, and some mercs you can play as or a limited time because of free-rotation, which cycles mercs every few weeks. You can permanently unlock Mercs with either ingame credits, or cash.This certainly isn't pay2win, because if you buy a merc, other people may be able to use it in a few weeks.It only takes about 6-10 hours of playtime to be able to afford a merc with ingame cash anyway.You can aim down sights, but it is not reccomended as there is nearly no (extreme) recoil, and it slows you down.Time to kill in this game is considerably long if you go for body shots, which is why headshots are always reccommended, as it's only 2-3 shots with an AR.Pros and Cons.Pros:-Attractive visuals-F2P, but buying things with cash does not give an unfair advantage-Accessible game with a high skill ceiling, easy to learn but hard to master-Free rotation mixes up gameplay-The game has ""under level 5"" servers for people new to the game-You're able to walljump twice and keep momentum, making awesome trick jumps and skill based movement possible-Gun play is great-Hitboxes seem fineNegatives:-Some maps and classes need tweaking, ie: longer cooldown for airstrikes-Lack of gamemodes and maps-The game requires a lot of communication and team work for your team to be successful.",1
2015,"Even in alpha and sandbox only, this is a fantastic game! Survival horror in a bleak but beautiful setting which is both relaxing and tense. The character need management is reminiscent of The Sims or This War of Mine - always trading off one factor for another. Even harvasting meat from a carcass requires a trade off with time and lowering body temperature.It is fun to plan your next exploration on the trail, slowly gathering the required food, water and fuel over a couple of days and then waiting for a break in the weather to go.When exploring, the maps are well particarly well designed, requiring a balance of both risk and caution to find those far-flung cabins. Many a time you roll into camp almost hypothermic, completely exhausted and in quickly fading dusk light.The player experience across time is rewarding. You go from being afraid of your environment and a complete survival noob to eventually feeling like you're some hardcore Canadian survivalist, stalking the wildlife in your hide clothing.Big thumbs up.",1

2015,Fun game with almost enough gore to keep me happy. They nerfed weapon accuracy back in January so most servers were full of melee Medics and Berserkers. I had levelled Sharpshooter to max so I quit around that point.,1
2015,"Great graphics. Clunky consolised controls, poor MP game balance, watered down console-tard storyline. Not even for fans of the Aliens, Predator and/or AvP franchises, unless very very cheap.",1
2015,"Probably the best RPG ever made. Four complete factions to join, dozens of endgame scenarios, freeroaming, mod support, choices and consequences. All the bugs have been squashed now, so there's nothing holding New Vegas back - play it.",1
2015,"Very fun game for the first 2 hours, then the difficulty falls off a cliff and most people stop playing. I've been back to push through a few times but the novelty is gone. A good buy, just know ahead of time that you will probably only get 2-3 hours gaming from it.",1
2015,"This is such a retro homage to old Sierra Quest style games, at least in the graphics.The game is very surreal, you are in a screen with a wacky scenario and have 20 seconds to find a bomb and stop it. The solutions are extremely bizarre and completely wrongheaded, and you keep repeating til you pass the level. Failure is more fun than success because the goal is just to laugh. Get it on sale for a dollar!",1
2015,"Even on my old crate, this runs well and has amazing graphics. You can free roam or smash the story quests really quickly, whatever is your priority. FPS combat gets broken up with relic hunting in old caves and WWII bunkers, hunting wild animals and minigames. You can go guns blazing or secret-squirrel stealth kill the bad guys. Or just rain down dozens of grenades from 250 metres away.All in all, I recommend.",1
2015,"As others have said far more articulately, with this Season of The Walking Dead your choices don't matter, the characters aren't memorable, the story is depressing to a fault, and the whole thing peaks early at the climax of Chapter 3.",1

2015,The planning man's game. Awesome.,1
2015,"This game has been faithfully updated whilst keeping its charm. The first time through may take you may hours, but it's rewarding if you figure it out yourself. Once through, there's little to return to, but I think I'll be coming back after a year to do it all again. OSX version worked perfectly, except the bonus conent doesn't work, and the achievements were a bit sketchy to register.",1
2015,"Never played before, and I'm actually learning. You have to fight through the frustration, and just keep practicing, but slowly I'm getting somewhere.",1
2015,"Very different. If you read too much about this game, you'll spoil it. If you think you've spoiled it, buy it now (if it's on sale), and play it later.",1
2015,"This is a very unique experience, that's over too soon. Within 3 hours, I'd completed most of what this game/narrative has to offer, but it was definately the most entertained I've been in a game for a long time. I do hope more content is added, but in the mean time, I'll be trying to solve some of the little mysteries left behind.",1
2015,"Game wasn't as hard as I thought (played 1st time on 2nd hardest setting as I normally do) and didn't really like the end.Nice gameplay throughout, only used the shooting crouched and run-slide during the tutorial stages, thought there would be less hints of where to go on the harder settings, I'd hate to try the game on the wimpy setting..The difference in difficulty on the 2nd hardest as compared to the original, well the original, I wouldn't have finished it yet.",1
2015,"Amazing game but i have encounted some serious problems, it ran fine for 2 hours, past that mark it crashed and now every time i try to start a new game it goes to the loading screen and then freezes, you can hear the sound of the character spawning into the water and when you click or press a button it comes up with ""Subnautica .exe not responding"" I'll re-installed the game and i am still having the same problem",1
2015,"Bought this game in 2000. I'm still finding new areas, conversations, documents and easter eggs. Best game ever. 10/10.",2
2015,"An absolutely superb effort and indispensable for any Deus Ex fan. This mod perfectly updates the original without sacrificing anything, allowing this classic experience to be brought to a whole new generation of gamers, while retaining everything long term fans adore. A wonderful way to keep DX alive, and so very respectful and reverential to the original. Amazing work -- I'm addicted.",2
2015,"Don't be deceived by the marketing for this game. This is not your typically shooter.To be honest, Spec Ops: The Line is not a great Third Person Shooter mechanically, but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable. It's just simple, in the way any TPS is.It can be frustrating during parts, but if you get past that, it's a great experience. You'll really want to play through this game atleast once for the story. The narrative makes some great statements on games in general, and how they glorify war and violence. It's not perfect, but it's admirable that a developer would take such a risk in storytelling in any case. It's worth supporting this game, at the very least for this.In general, it's a great PC Port, with only minor stuttering at times. Key rebinding is dodgy though. Definitely a console port.",1
2015,"From what I can gather, it's almost exactly like being in the real army as a proper soldier. Even guys that are actually real soldiers are saying this on the internet in forums and what have you. I guess they do this when they get back from a patrol or something and then start playing ARMA 3 and they're like 'hang on,this is supposed to be my layabout time, why am I putting myself through all of this again? And on my own dime to boot!' Anyway, Infinity Ward have created another scorcher with this one.",1
2015,"100% GOTY. First you are an astronaut,then you are a frogman then you drive a tank. It's really refreshing and original. I was running around shooting people, next minute I was on a helicopter with a minigun. But you have to watch it because they get really hot and you are not allowed to shoot anymore. So I took it easy. There is a bar which gets all red and shows you how hot it is getting. I generally let it get like 75% of the way and then I stop for a bit. It's a pain but it's pretty much realistic. I talked to a soldier once at Someplace Else in the city and he confirmed that you can't shoot a real gun forever, which is pretty much what I had expected. Kudos to Infinity Ward for taking the high road on that one. Anything less would be an insult to the real operators that keep us safe in our beds at night time. But I did not like the ♥♥♥♥ing dog. I am not an alsatian fan . They are an oily dog and the smell gets on everything (especially couches).",1
2015,In 45 minutes you are dying of thirst and starving. About to pass out. It's like being Paris Hilton in a zombie apocalypse which is a game that I dared to dream of but never thought would be realized. 5 stars. Would hit it again. Shigeru Miyamoto has managed to hit hit all the high notes and then some with this summer scorcher.,1
2015,"If you've played Europa Universalis and co, then this game is awesome. Enough said - buy it and dive in. If you've never played a Paradox game of this nature before then read on....This game has a steep learning curve, matched only by the joy from the gameplay after you get over the initial hump. My brother showed me the interface and took me through some of the concepts of the game initially which got me over that learning curve. I would recommend watching some kind of Youtube videos or reading up on the game concepts because it doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the terminology of the era.There's a moment when it just starts to click and when it does, it feels like you've opened a door to a whole new world of great gaming. I have spent more time playing this game than any other.I would recommend buying some of the expansion packs for flavour as the big ones have some excellent additions to the Crusader Kings gameplay however to start with, the normal game is great. I have always been a fan of the Total War series. This game is not that. It's not as hands on tactical (regarding battles and such), it's much more strategic in it's approach. It's much more personable. Your character, his or her family, friends, relations, vassals and enemies really MATTER.I have always been a fan of the Civ series. This game is not that. It's a much more in depth dive into the feudal system. Civilisation is a brilliant glimpse at the whole of human history. This is the PHD on the middle ages.If you're into strategy games, you deserve to play this and don't be put off by the initial learning barrier. Because when you're succeeding at this game, there's no feeling like it.",1
2015,No anxiety in your life? Unable to cope with your sense of peace and control? Look no further! Start playing Mini Metro and be cured today!Brilliant design - simplicity itself. Just like a good safe. Bloody difficult to crack.,1
2015,"OK it's fair to say I'm a big fan of Ancient Greece and Greek Mythology but even so, this is a really fun platformer action game, reminiscent of the old platformer 'Gods' although this is only focused on Greece.So far it's been very entertaining, the story is simple but compelling and thematically the game is excellent. The music, art style, characters and such is very well done. I only noticed recently that the game levels are actually painted on a rock or plaster surface. Very nice touch. You can tell this has been a labour of love and they haven't bit off more than they can chew in the art direction and design. Initially you may think the simple palette limited compared to the vibrance of contemporary games but actually it is very subtle and it doesn't take too long see why they did it. Awesome work.Gameplay is simple yet varied enough to maintain your interest through the hack'n'slash. There have been a few surprises that have me wondering what else they have up their sleeve. I'm really enjoying the variety of equipment that's all tied back to actual Greek weapons and armour with a few added mythological notes as you'd expect.All in all, a well crafted game. Enough complexity and the difficulty so far has been challenging enough without bumping it up to 'champion' level.Great stuff by the developer to put this all together. And I got it for $5. Go buy this and take a break from the AAA titles!",1

2015,"I've been playing zombie games for years, Dead Rising, Dead Island, L4D, Killing Floor, DayZ, H1Z1. Uninstalled them all after playing Dying Light. THIS is the definitive zombie game. Huge maps, high difficulty, gorgeous graphics, excellent coop, well optimised and detailed gore. Totally different voice acting/script to Dead Island too, this game really pulls at your heart-strings. Plus, this game regularly scares the hell out of me. After years of playing video games, you kind of get numb to that. Lots of references to other games, plus Dying Light feels like Mirror's Edge, Assassins Creed, and Dead Island except done better.

2015,"I've been looking for a FTP MMO to scratch the WoW itch for a number of years. Having a subscription meant that I felt like I HAD to play WoW to get that money's worth, which was a big part of the addiction for me. I convinced myself (hitting rock-bottom may have had something to do with it) that cancelling my sub and waiting for WoW to go FTP was the only course of action. That was many years ago. In that time, I have played GW2, Tera, Wildstar, the Perfect World, ESO, LOTR Online, Star Trek Online, SWTOR, Aion, the list goes on. If it's an MMO, I've played it, in the hopes of filling that void that WoW left. Nothing even clame close to comparing. Then I came across Riders of Icarus. I started a Guardian class, and I fell in love. I got the feels, the dreams of the game while I slept, waking only to think about strats and what I would accomplish in game that day. I joined a guild and met people that actually helped, and were happy to give up their time to grind dungeons with me. I began to scour wikipedia to learn as much as I could about this game, and became a wealth of knowledge to my guildmates. Finding ways to counter botters in-game, memorizing locations of rare spawns, bosses and item drops. I found ways to farm gold and crafting mats. I found ways to profit on the AH. Days went by, 3 days after the game's release, I'd amassed 36 hours of game time. I was hooked. I'd found my WoW replacement; hell, in ways it was beginning to outshine WoW. But best of all? It's free to play. Yes, it's a Nexon game. Just don't make purchases with real currency in-game, and you won't have any issues. (It's FTP anyway, serves pay to winners right).Yes, botters are a problem, but you can create your own channel, and specify what displays in that channel. As for bots camping spawns, the system works on first hit. The bot timers for this are good, but not perfect. Just get the first hit in through spamming your auto-attack. Changing channels also works for this most times.Yes, the quests are mostly kill x, gather x, escort x, but at no point did I become bored, at no point did the grind become tedious.As I've progressed through the game, I've been repeatedly impressed by the difficulty of it. I've marvelled at the beauty of the scenery around me. I've experienced little to no lag (a miracle for an Aust player) I've grown attached to Elite pets and mounts that I've sought out and tamed, I've been saddened at saying goodbye to pets and mounts that had outlived their usefulness or been made redundant by better, stronger, faster mounts, with higher HP and Energy pools.But my journey has only just begun. I'm moving interstate for work IRL, and the week between moving out of the house that I currently occupy and the house that I'm moving to before I can access stable internet again will be difficult to endure. But I will be back. I will return to this amazing world, and I will grow stronger. I haven't even come close to discovering all that this game has to offer, and I can only imagine the lands and content that await me when I return. Visuals: 9.5/10Gameplay: 8.5/10Story: 9/10Overall: 9/10 - It's Free to Play, what are you waiting for? Download it and see for yourself.

2015,"Spacebase DF-9 – PreviewBy GMCamulosGenre: Simulation, Indie, StrategyPlatform: PC / Mac / Linux Publisher / Developer: Double Fine ProductionsFrom the Devs:“Spacebase DF-9 is a simulation game in ongoing development at Double Fine Productions. Alpha 3b version is available right now for Windows, Mac, and Linux.”Gameplay:So the first simulation strategy game I ever played was Theme Hospital, and I am SO glad that the basics have stayed the same.Spacebase DF-9 still being in early access alpha stages at the moment means there are still some bugs that need fixing, but that is not to say that the game is not engaging and fun right now, because it very much is! From the get go you start where you want to. You pick the location to start from the galaxy map which has different indicators as to how that area will play. From how many minerals will be there for you to mine when you arrive, how close you are to warp gates for new visitors (good and bad) and even the areas magnetic field levels. Once you find an area you like the looks of, you travel to that area in your trusty SEED Capsule with your three starting inhabitants in your roster.You start off with 6 minutes of air in their space suits so it’s a good idea to build your beginning base as quickly as possible.From there the game progresses with new rooms to build onto your ship, the need for food and clean air. Refineries to turn your mined resources into useable material and the delight of new people arriving at your station and the pain of having raiders try to destroy your base.The main issue I currently have with the alpha (which I assume will be fixed pretty soon) is that half the time I need something built quickly to stop bad things happening… my builders decide that they have other more important things to do (which has resulted in everyone on my base dying from starvation about four times now).But if you have played any simulation game in the past, it’s a quick pickup to learn how the game mechanics work and no trouble from there on in.Graphics:For an early access Alpha release, the game clearly shows it has had some graphical polish sought early in development. The rich backgrounds and effects used in the game provide a very crisp and clean alpha. Not much variation once you start building, but you never know, the developers at Double Fine may add some randomisation when building rooms in a later release?Sound:The game does have a nice background track playing and there are some audio assets in the game, but nothing that really stood out or shocked me. I look forward to more sound assets being added in the future, but in alpha development that is not something you really wait with baited breath for.Skill Levels and Controls:As I stated at the start, I have been playing simulation games for a while now. And most gamers would be able to tell you the jist of what happens in The Sims. So its not hard to understand that the game runs pretty smoothly for most gamers. Each hotkey is listed on the action in your GUI menu for building and assignment of rosters, so no trouble there. Camera is a quick to grasp control setup as well. You basically zoom in and out and use the W,S,A,D keys to move around the map.I think a veteran simulation player would have the best bet of survival in their first base run. But it is not 100% clear at first what is needed when and how much of something is a good idea to start with. So expect a bit of restarting as you work things out. Which leads to:Replayability:Like most simulation and strategy games, there is a metric tonne of replayability, even at this alpha stage. The maps are randomly generated when you start based on the map level indicators when you pick your base local from the galaxy map, BUT you get to choose where on the map you build your first room, and from that first room, the choice is all up to you how you want to build. The random encounters of new inhabitants and raiders also helps determine what to build next. But I dare say, no two bases will ever be the same!At the moment though you can only have one base saved at a time. You start a base, then save and exit. If you start a new one and then save and exit it DOES overwrite the old base, so be careful.Last thoughts:I spent a bit during the last STEAM sales, but I am very very glad I picked up this little gem. It’s a fun take on space base simulation, and holds a lot of potential.I will be keeping an eye out for future dev plans for this one and recommend that if you have the $24.99 then you should pick this one up for your library.",1
2015,"Bound By Flame – ReviewBy GMCamulosGenre: RPGPlatform: PC, PS4, PS3, 360Publisher: Focus Home InteractiveDeveloper: SpidersWhen creating a game what do I want to add? A nice dash of action, some good graphics, great sound in both music/ambient and voice acting, a nice control system, a hint of swearing, a little somethin’ somethin’ for the guys, and conversely nice looking guys for the ladies out there, some good story elements, nice character progression and levelling and a metric tonne of other small little things that fill in the gaps between the aforementioned.Now, can Bound By Flame find the right mix or has the ever omnipotent game master added a dash too much of one ingredient and not another?Gameplay:Bound By Flame was an interesting one pre-release. It looked like it had something really kicking for it. A nice combat style, a demon possessed player character (true we have seen a lot of those in the past), and hey, it was next-gen.What we got from it was a fun solid (in areas) next-gen RPG. The story for Bound By Flame is that your character is a member of a mercenary force called the Freeborn Blades that are trying to protect the world from the Icelords who slowly taking over and killing anything they come across. The Red Scribes who hired the mercs to protect them while they find an ancient temple and try to perform a ritual to help out… can we see where this is going?The ritual obviously has to go wrong cause is the start of the game and all, and your character is left with a very nice and friendly demon residing in him… I mean let’s see, how bad could that actually be right?The demon will eventually try to get you to make the choices which suit IT best, which can lead to a very interesting storyline as your companions will treat you differently if they think you are turning evil. So should you embrace the evil and grow an awesome set of horns and look like you are constantly warming up people three towns away, or will you keep your humanity and make choices that help rather than hinder?Well if you go evil you will find that the demon can be a nice kick into the powerful meter, but the choice is yours.It’s just a pity that its strongest feature is a nice combat and skill system. The three skill trees are Ranger, Warrior and Pyromancer.I dare say you only spec into one of the Ranger or Warrior classes depending on how you want to play but some of the Pyro skills are very complimenting, such as the ability to have a nice fire shield or even ignite your weapon for more damage.A quick warning before moving on, the game did kind of shock me the first time I met an elf and my whole opinion of how they can converse was tipped upside down. The occasional swear in a game is fine, but when half the cast will try to slip one in every third sentence, it drags away from it being a fantasy game and just tries to tip into a game for less mature players.And don’t get me started on the fact that one of your more… well-endowed female companions looks like she could be shivering just looking at a fridge given what she is wearing… I still don’t understand the need to make a female character in a game have less protection than a male character… breastplates on guys… yet a breastplate on a girl will cup the breasts and show them off… I just don’t get it…And given that there is crafting in the game I kind of wish there was more I could craft, though the recycle feature to get some materials back is a very handy touch to let you experiment with what you want to make and use/upgrade.Graphics:The game is next gen, so I would have liked to have seen a little more… pezaz? Don’t get me wrong, it’s still solid and I can’t really fault it, but it’s still just at a level that says… yeah, we know we are making things for next gen, but we need it to work on everything else at the same time.Nice little touches pop up here and there, such as the changes your character goes through the more you let your demonic inner voice take over… but its things we have seen before in other games.Sound:The sound is good, if we don’t talk about the lacking performance on the majority of companions. There is something to be said about your demon side and his influence and conversational chats, but the majority of the team seem to let me down. A nice casual chat while a player dies, no inflection of pain or regret, just “Yep I am dying…” ok, yeah, thanks… I mean, don’t say that, it’s not your time… bit more work could have gone into this side of the game, and I don’t just say that because I know a lot of voice actors who could use work *wink wink*Skill Levels and Controls:Bound By Flames combat never really had me at a point where I felt UBER as I quite often get to in other RPG’s. The game really does ease you into how the combat and levelling works at a nice solid pace in the first section, and just keeps going from there. On normal it still felt like the monsters of the world were levelling at the same time I was, it’s just that I was able to put points into my skill tree’s that continually allowed me to stay ahead of the curve. Some fights still gave me a bit of a headache, but still, nothing you can’t overcome.Your choice of companions can also help with battle and thus can complement or just strengthen your play style, bit of a choice there to help out as well.Replayability:With the amount of choices in the game, and deciding what you want to do, the game has a little replayability unless you want to see what it’s like to swap from allowing the demon to take over, or to be the man in charge all the way through. But it’s an RPG, when you know the story, you know the story. Nothing major is going to change from playing through it again. Last thoughts:I did enjoy Bound By Flame, it’s a great little RPG which does have a lot of merits. I do kind of wish the game was longer and had a bit more variety, but hey, on the whole I did enjoy it and had a lot of fun playing through it all the same.I give it 7 Demonic Possessions out of 10.",1
2015,The most fun I have had playing a game in a long time.Castlevania crossed with mexican wrestling and many pop/video game culture refereces scattered through out.   The fact that this is the first game in a long time (see; years) in which I have had a play session of 4+ hours says it all!,1

A brilliant follow up to RTCW, a brilliant fun romp through a very well thought out and indeed terribly bleak alternate world, where the /whatif is ""What if the Nazis won?""As a history buff, it's definitely something on which I've thought quite a bit, and if you ever wondered yourself, well son, I think you'll find this a pretty good attempt at capturing what could have been, albeit with a little kazz thrown in, but we'll call that artistic license shall we?Do yourself a favour, get you some of this, and don't forget to do both paths.",1

2015,"This game is great for fans of the original Alien movie! And stealth game fans.I have played this through on hard and I can say the AI is as good as they say, I have had to deal with a lot of bad AI and bad AI is worse when you are in a stealth game. The Alien is random (or “Sudo Random” as programing usually is) it does patrol in different areas but it is not as ridged as the patrols of as say the Hitman games. In one example I decided to follow it so I would know where it was and not bump into it, unfortunately it stopped and decided to turn around and back track = Dead > Reload. I then started to base movement on hiding spots, I rated Lockers as Medium since the alien more often sniffs them out and you lose health while holding your breath, at the top I had well positioned tables with no line of sight to doors, I had a premo spot that was behind a reception desk in a corner, I thought this was safe….Wrong! The alien walked by a few times while waited to time my move to the next room and it decided it hadn’t checked my hiding spot and walked around the desk and peeked under = Dead > Reload.As for the many many bad reviews I have read listing “Plot holes” all I can say is if you have not watched Alien with Directors commentary and seen the cut scenes then you have no idea about the Alien universe and should not be commenting on them. From the start this game has been a homage to the original movie not Aliens or Alien 3, you don’t get the whole picture you are just an average WY Engineer stuck in a mess. Your main priority is getting off the station not figuring out the how and the why, you get snippets of that along the way but mainly you just don’t want to die.Minor Spoiler Alert / Hint (No details but you’ll get some of the plot) Aside from my points above the ambiguity of the alien life cycle in this game can be explained. If you have ever watched any documentaries on Bees and how sister bees are ‘supressed’ chemically it becomes viable for sister bees to start reproducing when not being supressed by a queen, check out this BBC link for more info http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/17854061. Without spoiling the plot too much this game can tie in to the originals and can expand on it without interfering with the trilogy canon. (I do not recognise Resurrection as a movie, I am in denial, it never happened, la la la la.)The game does have some bugs and slightly annoying dynamics, floating revolvers, revolvers that you can’t pick up as it is a scripted event, or the lack of any jumping ability (Oh look small boxes are blocking my path oh well I can’t jump over them). Also painfully slow access to terminals and hacking, I would start a hack only to hear the alien drop from a nearby vent, frantically I’d try to cancel the hack and it would take forever! If I was in that position I would drop what I was doing and F*%$ off quick smart.This game has potential for expansion on an open station theme, I would have liked to see a game mode that started you out on the station before the alien starts killing people, it would have been like a game of last man standing. You & station NPCs are trying to survive as long as possible and you can access all parts of the station with the right tools, said tools can be accessed from the start and not in story stages like the campaign.Overall I think Alien Isolation is an excellent game with a great amount thought put into a classic Alien story line, the environments are polished, characters are very detailed and voiced acted very well. Also even after my first play though I am still hiding under desks and in lockers refusing come out, the game should be called Locker Simulator.",1
2015,"So it seems from my few moments of play (post smashing through Storm 3), that they have created whole new anime scenes and background lore for the Naruto storylines.High quality animation and anime cutscenes seperate the main fights while providing a never before seen storyline/back story to the Naruto narrative.Fighting/mechanics are very similar to Storm 3, with a few things seeming smoother.Nice addition to the franchise but could be regarded as a massive DLC realistically.The extra storylines portrayed via anime is incredible as I've followed Naruto from the begginning and a game hasn't shown something that's not been in the anime before (nothing major anyways).The first 'story' mission is ""The beginning of the Akutsuki"" which is basically the origins story of them.good fun.am drunk.",2
2015,Incredible.One of the best games ever created.Recommendations For Gameplay:- Turn Subtitles Off- Play on second most difficulty,2
2015,"From playing for almost 4 hours and openning up more of the gameplay, it's incredible.Good fun, refreshingly new systems in play, combat's good once you get the hang of it.Having so many characters to manage is a bit overwhelming since I don't really care about any of them, but i'm sure that'll come soon.Only negative reviews are from stupid people expecting a next gen Final Fantasy.It runs fun with whatever fps lock there is apparently on there.Looks great too, apart from a few things where you just question what the hell happened, overall it looks good enough.This is a $30 Final Fantasy title with great gameplay and story.What more do you want?(FFXV obviously :P)",2

2015,"Being a VIP Backer of this game when it was started on kickstarter I got to watch this game develop from the ground up and can happily say that the progress in which it has come from the tech demo is awesome. Awesome vehicles, a solid assortment of vehicles with awesome add-ons to change up on the trucks to suit any situation whether it be needed for hauling, repairing, fueling or just plain Sunday cruising. Awesome terrain with water crossings, narrow timber bridges, hill climbs, dirt roads, muddy roads, tarmac roads or why not make your own road. It can be a logistical nightmare whilst doing long hauls on your own whilst having to consider damaging your vehicle, low fuel and just plain getting lost but with multiplayer being implemented it is sure to be the perfect package.  If you are like me and love driving, driving games or even off-roading in real life then this is the game for you. You will not find a better off roader. Highly recommended! EDIT: Check out my screenshots on my profile!",2

2015,"I havn't been addicted to any game at all in years. This is the first, and I think I've sampled just about every MMO / RPG (or had until it went insane). Get this game. It's what Diablo III should have been, but so much more.",0

2015,A quirky adventure that will keep you coming back again and again...,1
2015,10/10 would recommend. Great skins & gameplay +1 to value,2
2015,"Love it.Great story, fun gameplay even if the game is getting a little dated these days.Just a shame the sequels won't be on Steam anytime soon.",1
2015,Still one of the best games of all time.Everyone should have it if they enjoy RTS games.,1
2015,"This isn't just any tower defense game... (For an asking price of $25 you would hope not!) but THE tower defense game.If you enjoyed the origional Defense Grid, you will enjoy this.",1
2015,This game is actually full of crap. Don't bother. Seriously boring.,0
2015,I would have to say that this game is one of my favourites as it has millions of things to do from sandbox messing around to roleplaying to hide and seek. Hours and hours of fun has been had on this game and i definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone.,1
2015,A great improvement from the previous counterstrike as in now includes a competitive side to it. With the competitive play it brings a whole new side of the game bringing out the gamer in all. This first person shooter uses a round by round game play in which weapons are bought each round. I believe that it out runs all other FPS games in the industry.,1
2015,This game is a fun game based around the movement of joints and the fighting of characters. It is a fun game that involves strategic moves and intense fighting situations. You can go up against real players or you can create your own scenarios with many different game modes and mods to play.,1
2015,This game is a fun game that is very challenging. Due to it being made by one person i would have to say it is very well made as there isn't much content in the game but can create an hour or so of fun/raging. It uses blocks for the creation of everything. Overall i would have to say that this game was a good investment of a dollar as I enjoyed playing it.,1
2015,The game is great! Lots of potential. I love the frequent updates.,2

2015,One of the best online games of all time!!.....The OG of Modern Warfare....A must get for first person shooter fanatics....,1
2015,"An extremely fun game with hints of a 'Call of Duty' play-style  and 'Team Fortress 2' wackiness. The balance of the two styles makes the game unique, giving the feel of a competitive game that doesn't take itself seriously. I recommend this game to any lovers of First Person shooters, however this game does come with it's fair share of issues.-The Matchmaking issues are present making it seem as if there aren't any players online. (As I am in Australia, I had to change my  Steam 'Download region' to US Chicago to have any hopes of playing.)-A seeming lack of dedicated servers seem present as the game, most of the time, assigns a 'Host' for the matches making gameplay very laggy at times.This aside, Gotham City Impostors is still a very solid game that needs an equally solid community to keep it alive.I still, however, recommend this game.",1

2015,"It's enjoyable enough, easy, not much/any challenge. You just kind of roll through it & the end is nigh.A kiddies' version of Mark of the Ninja, except the gushing blood, & adult themes of cut-scenes preclude children from playing it.Get Mark of the Ninja instead.",1

2015,"Fun. Replayable. Worth it.You may think you need to know more than that, but you don't really.There's plenty of tracks, they're well made, they're both challenging AND fun, there's plenty to achieve & find, and you will keep coming back to it time after time. Even when you're done with it you're still likely to want to have a play once in a while.There's wheel, chassis, engine upgrades, which obviously make the bike lighter, faster etc; but also change the handling of the bike. The controls are simple enough to jump straight into yet the maps & physics require mastery.If you beat your friends at any challenge your pic goes up on the in-game billboards so they all see it as they ride-by & fail. ;)I can't say whether it is better or worse than others in the series, but on it's own I can't find anything to complain about.It's worth the price & if on sale it's a no-brainer.",1

2015,It has Unicorns???What's there not to like?,1
2015,"In no other online multiplayer game have I tried so hard to actively avoid the multiplayer element of the game.  The whole time you're playing, there's just that little bit of background tension, generated by nothing more than knowing that they're out there somewhere.  No matter where you are, someone could be watching you down their sights.  At any time, you could die a quick and unexpected death.  The sound of gunfire is no more harrowing than the sound of footsteps outside the building you're in, or even the unexpected sound of a Zluta being cracked open nearby.  That's usually when I back myself up into the corner of the room, aim my gun at the door, and wait - all the while my heart pounding away in my ears.And when someone does open that door... well, that's when it gets really interesting.",1

2015,No.,1
2015,"Its challenging and interesting. With game elements such as Tower Defense and Turn-Based/Real-Time components, the current alpha will take some thinking to get through, even if it is only a few levels.The goal of the game is to explore the ""Dungeon"" to find the exit point. The exit point isnt for your characters, but rather an Artifact that you must protect and transport. The Artifact isnt solely for the Capture the Flag purpose, it must be defended whilst you are exploring the dungeon, since all damage done is taken out of an important resource that can only be gained through exploring, killing enemies and selling items (from what I have discovered).By Turn-Based, we can classify the turns as the opening of a new room. You build up your defenses and manage resources/heroes in real time, with no chance of being attacked. As soon as a door is opened, there is a chance of gaining loot, meeting a character, or initiating a wave of aliens. The aliens may not only come from that room, but other rooms that you have opened that have no line of sight. So by using the free time, you prepare your defenses for the eventuality that the aliens come. You move your characters in Real Time and can build structures during alien waves (albeit at a slower rate) to defend.When you are completing the goal of transporting the diamond to the end point, it triggers an All or Nothing alien swarm spawn, with large, endless waves of aliens preventing you from completing the final goal. Yes, you may get the diamond to the end, but can all your heroes survive? Their deaths will carry on to the next level, and you need all hands on deck. Did you use too many resources levelling up/healing or building structures? The leftovers also carry over to your next game. The graphics are not really an issue. There is a factor of fun I really enjoy. I am not sure if multiplayer could be incorporated into this game, uunless it is a coop - pvp fight against the aliens, cooperating or fighting to get the artifact to the exit first. Many hopes for this game that it turns out as well as i had fun playing it.",1
2015,This game has provided me with over 100 hours of entertainment and will continue to do so. For a lover of good old fashioned AOE style strategy games i was a bit skeptical of XCOM at first as i wasnt sure how a futuristic strategy would work. The different turn by turn mechanics of this game is something that not only revitalises the genre but creates a depth of gameplay and graphics as wellThe whole idea of levelling up soldiers and modiftying them in Enemy Within (also recommend highly) combines an RPG feel to the game9/10 - Best strategy game ive ever played- T,1
2015,"Unreal tourney meets Mech worrior!This game favours strategy over skills, the pace of the game and adequate lag compensation means competing internationally is possible. The mechs are fairly balanced and are more of a 'in the right hands' situation (I didn't play pre-balance but I imagine a lot of the complaints come from vets who found a nieche). It's possible to still MVP with the default mech should you pilot correctly! (even on the east cost servers from Australia)Cons: Upgrade system is heavily geared to the f2p model (you cannot share parts between mechs), abandoner's wreck up matches as they are constantly leaving to find an easy win for daily rewards. Hopefully the new devs address all these and free an amazing game from the shackles of f2p.Pros: Its not hard to be effective with any given mech when you play as a team, the p2w complaint is a moot point. Runs well, looks like a Blomkamp flim. You can play and unlock any mech and upgrades. Excellent combat system. Australian servers are back up!For the short term its a fun game with great strategy, hopefully in the long term the player base grows as the new devs take the reigns and help the game to flourish!",1
2015,Tim Burton's animation style + Minecraft's survival mechanics + Dark Souls unforgiving nature  = Dont Starve.,1
2015,"good, fun remake of the original.For those that have played the original it's worth the nostalgia. Be warned that it has been simplified (it's been made more mainstream)",1
2015,F****** great game.If you loved the original Thief(s) you will love this game. I actually rate this game higher than the new Thief and i personally LOVED the old thief games. Greate gameplay and story.......i recomend getting the knife of dunwall DLC and the Brigmore Witches DLCOnly downside is the number of missions is low but even then worth every penny.,1
2015,Uh Eh Uh.I am glad they made a new Thief. I really missed the stealth theft.However it doesn't fell like the old thief games. It isn't EPIC enough. The story is lacking and a bit predictable. The characters aren't that intresting. Gameplay is okay. If you get a good deal and you like steath games then it might be worth it.I gave it a thumbs up because i really want them to make more (and better) thief games.,1
2015,Even COD comes up with new concepts every few years or so.CSGO doesn't feel like a new game it feels like counter strike. It hasn't changed much. Some people may like that but if you are a person that doesn't play 1 game for 10 years then you will probably be underwhelmed. Verdict: If you have never played CS then you can get it. If you played previous version of CS you may get bored.,1
2015,City Builder (well really village builder)with a focus on BALLANCE. You have to finely tune your village. Every resource you collect you use internally. If you liked any of the original Settlers games you will probably like this,1

2015,"4 survivors fight their way through zombie infested areas, ranging from swamps to amusement parks to cities. The basic format is this; you have 5 item slots, your primary gun, a secondary gun, a thrown item, a major health item and a minor health item. You begin with very little, a basic pistol and a weak primary, usually either a shotgun or an uzi. You then fight your way past hordes of sprinting zombies to get to the checkpoint. Each campaign has several checkpoints, culminating in a final area which is usually the most insane part of the map, for example, you are in a rock arena fighting zombies on stage with guitars. Additionally, there are several special zombies who will make your day hard. They each incapacitate you in some way, meaning your fellow survivors have to rescue you.If you've read this far and are not interested, don't buy this game. Personally, it's the best co-op shooter I've played... ever. I will continue to play this periodically until L4D3 arrives most likely.4/5",1
2015,"The best way to describe this game is Left 4 Dead, but instead of a Zombie Apocalypse, it's a Heist. Also, it has a deep customisation system with four skill trees, hordes of weapons with customisations and of course, customisable (and very cool, imho) masks for your robber. Additionally, missions (heists) have multiple elements that are randomised each time you play, so it's 'never the same heist twice.'I will be playing this game for quite some time, as Overkill has already promised 12 months of content. The only downside is that the A.I. is kinda dumb sometimes and the graphics are not industry standard, but being as this game is the price of an indy game, it exceeds all expectations.The TL;DR version is this game is great value if you want a solid co-op game and don't mind the idea of slaughter hoards of police when you set off the alarm.",1
2015,"I waited a long time to buy this; I played CS for years back when going to a LAN Cafe and paying by the hour was still a thing. Then, years went by and despite having CS:S in my Library, I never really went back to it. I was happy with TF2 and Payday 2 for all my shooter needs. Then. Steam sales and whatnot happened and after reading about 50 Steam reviews, I decided what the heck and bought it.5 hours in and I'm very happy I did. CS:GO has planted a bomb at Site A; my heart... I don't know if that metaphor works... but yes, I was surprised. I played a bit of Casual before taking a deep breath and jumping into a Comp match.Wow, such fun. I wasn't flamed for being awful. I was playing with people with dozens and hundreds of hours on their CS clock and still managing to be slightly better than completely useless.And now, with all this TF2 style unlockable ♥♥♥♥ (which I am a complete sucker for) and a variety of challenged and whatnot, this game now has a place on my coverted Favourites. Highly recommend; even at full price ($15) it's a great deal. Cheaper than COD or BF and I would argue better in many ways. Get on it.",1
2015,"Randomly came across this game while looking at top rated free-to-play games and just a few days later I have 80+ hours.It may not be for you, but for those of us who've grinded their way through difficult games, it's fun to be rewarded for doing nothing.A+EDIT: Another 20 hours... There is more to this game than I originally thought... Got my 3 active Ancients and a bunch of early Gilded heroes. Might break 200 this Ascension...EDIT 2: 200+ hours now... Oh dear.

My gaming rig is Ubuntu Linux 16.04 running on Intel Xeon E3 + Nvidia GTX760 + Samsung 950 PRO.The game will complain about the drive(nvidia 361) but it will run anyway. I set graphics quality to HIGH and the framerate is bearable for a turn based game. For about 30 hours I played, it crashed once, and froze for a minute when my sharpshooter tried headshot a Archon. Other than that everything was wonderful.Ranger is pretty OP from what I've seen. It's great that 1 soldier can carry the other knocked down yet still alive soldier to a safe place. Also the concealed mode is a nice addition to existing tactical elements.",1
2015,"This game is amazing. I've played so many levels it's crazy, and I'm not even halfway to completing all of them. I've played 62 hours, more than most AAA games I own, and CW is far more fun than them too. Highly recommended.",2
2015,"In it's current state, JC3 is broken. Driver crashes keep me from ever entering the actual world. Well done Avalanche. But from my ""19 minutes played"" in the menu screen, it's not great. An unskippable 30 wait till...a DRM/online login which takes 15s. Then a loading screen for another 30s...all to take me back to the very first screen I saw, but now with an option to start the game. So it's taken 2 minutes before I was able to get to the main menu. Disgraceful.On top of that, some of the keybindings in the GUI tab are unchangeable, which is ♥♥♥♥ing useless considering I'm left handed and need to change the bindings to play properly.In short, a myriad of unskippable waits, driver crashes, poor interface design and DRM make this game totally unplayable.

2015,"Sweet. Mother. Of. Christ!This game somehow manages to be visceral while also making you play in a methodical, tactical manner. It's understated and yet bombastic at the same time.Simply put: play pre-made campaign maps to acquire money, use that money to purchase pilots, vehicles (mech/tanks), weapons and semi-procedural missions then mix and match for huge replay value in the freelance mode. It's a super simple career-esque formula that feels like an arcade version of MechWarrior Mercenaries and I love it!(NOTE: I say ""career mode"", but it really isn't that deep, don't expect a management game here).Combat is satisfying and varied due to the wild loadout combinations you can create; fast, light mechs with heavy weapons, giant, slow walkers with enough ""dakka"" to put the greenskins to shame and any variation in between. I personally recommend the 'Fork' mech with dual 'disco' turrets (example  here).The game is not easy, but at no point does it feel unfair. It can be difficult to get the hang of aiming at first, but all the projectile arc information really is right there in front of you, so it doesn't take long to figure out. As long as you don't rush in and try to take on swarms of enemies all at once you should be good. Just like MechWarrior Online, this is a form of cover shooter; sneak behind buildings and only engage when you've got the advantage. And speaking of buildings, everything is destructible... and I mean everything.In conclusion, it's a simple isometric mech/tank action game with some light customisation, fully destructible environments and a great synthwave soundtrack.

2015,"Click here for the video.Grey Goo is a new RTS from Petroglyph Games that removes unnecessary micro and brings back the classic gameplay you may remember from Command & Conquer's glory days.ProsInteresting and varied, asymmetrical factions. There truly is something for every play style here.The tech system limits the player in a good way, giving weight to your choice of tech upgrades without shutting you off from other options permanently.Presentation: Animations, sound FX, voice acting and cutscenes are all superbly polished. While it's not the most high-fidelity game ever made it does look very nice as a whole. Even on the lowest graphical settings the game doesn't look muddy or outdated.The map editor ships with the game at launch, opening up a potentially infinite amount of map variation for the future.The eight maps that ship with the game are, for the most part, asymmetrical, well designed and feel balanced. It feels great playing on non-mirrored maps for once.The campaign and story are above average for an RTS game. The story is supremely compelling with fantastically animated cutscenes (the best I've ever seen) and the campaign offers subtle, interesting variations on the skirmish gameplay through fifteen lengthy missions. It will likely take you a couple of days to complete the campaign and some of the later mission are quite challenging indeed.ConsPerformance: The frame-rate drops with large amounts of units and structures on screen and towards the end of longer matches. Adjusting the graphics options does very little to alleviate this.Only eight maps are available at launch, five 1v1 and three 2v2. I imagine they'll be adding more in the future, but I can't be sure of that at this point.What you need to knowThe game doesn't ship with replay or observer mode features, but they have been confirmed for a post-launch update.Grey Goo doesn't play like StarCraft and thus you shouldn't play it as such. Understand and accept this and you'll be happier for it.If you enjoyed Command & Conquer 3 you'll likely find something to enjoy in Grey Goo.The game supports competitive play with ranked 1v1 and 2v2 matches along with a leaderboard for each.Custom 1v3, 1v1v2 and Free For All games are also supported. The max number of players on a map is currently four.ConclusionGrey Goo is a solid old school style RTS. It has some interesting new ideas and brings back much missed old ones too. It seems that Petroglyph Games has tried to cater to the single and multiplayer communities with Grey Goo; this perhaps coupled with a shorter development time has led the game to feel as if it lacks content in certain areas. That being said, the game doesn't feel unfinished by any stretch of the imagination, though it could use an expansion or a few updates here and there to fatten it up a bit (this is almost guaranteed considering the cliffhanger at the end of the campaign). Grey Goo is a solid and polished foundation for a potentially great RTS.For more Grey Goo and other exciting content check out my YouTube channel, The Roleplay Gamer.",1
2015,"Video review: https://youtu.be/9hmhxWHcrPgDo you like FTL and Mad Max? Well, you're in luck because they had sex and produced the two-headed, roguelike love child that is Convoy.The game is set on a post-apocalyptic world where 80's and 90's film and television references pepper the skies. Your ship has crash landed and you're tasked with finding replacement parts to get the old girl flying again. This puts you in charge of the MCV and two combat vehicles, making up your convoy. Your convoy crawls across the map chasing down leads and getting into trouble. You can upgrade your vehicles with new weapons and equipment and even purchase more vehicles to add to your convoy. You must protect your MCV at all costs, for once it's destroyed the game is over.When you get right down to it, Convoy plays very much like FTL. The difference is Convoy gives you more tools to help you determine your fate. You can manoeuvre your vehicles into cover or out of the range of your enemy's guns, spend extra fuel to escape ambushes you don't think you can win and you can track down a camp at any time outside of combat in order to repair and refuel. This doesn't mean the game is easy by any stretch of the imagination, over confidence is the biggest killer out in the wasteland and sometimes you'll find yourself in situations where you just can't avoid losing one of your vehicles. All in all, the best weapon you have in Convoy is being prepared.The GoodYou're presented with a lot of options throughout your travels. Maybe one of the factions hires you to transport a crate for them. Will you deliver it no questions asked or look inside? It turns out the crate is holding a shipment of undernourished slaves. Will you set them free, make them work in your convoy or put them back in the crate and sell them on the black market. All options are viable and not at all bound to a linear morality system. The choice is entirely yours to be noble, pragmatic or sinister. Furthermore, almost all interactions with NPC's allow you to shoot first and ask questions later or not ask questions at all. This is really where Convoy shines, its no-holes-bared willingness to let you be a complete and utter d@#k to everyone around you.Bosses take the form of enemy MCV's or giant flying machines of death. So long as you make liberal use of the pause button, though, the boss fights aren’t infuriatingly difficult, you always feel like you have a chance. But if you're not prepared and the enemy starts attacking your MVC on low health it's all over.As stated above, Convoy is littered with film and television references. While some might find it cheese or cheap, I personally enjoy that style of writing a great deal. It's a game that wears its influences on its sleeve and, as a fan of those influences, I'm A-ok with that.The BadThe game has bugs. Nothing game-breaking, but it is a nuisance nonetheless. Sometimes the UI will freak out and overlap on itself or if your MCV is destroyed a moment after you defeat an enemy the game will keep going even though you can't actually do anything without the MCV. Restarting the game seems to fix these issues, but it is a mark against the overall polish of the game.What You Need To KnowBugs, bugs, bugs...There are a lot of customisation options for your vehicles. Different guns do different things and fire in different ways and with different arcs and line of sight requirements. You can even turn your MCV into a glorious, throbbing weapons platform of death!More MCV and side vehicle options and variants can be unlocked by reaching certain milestones in the game.The game can get quite dark in places, especially if you're selling slaves or shooting innocent people. Something to be wary of, if you're soft and sensitive.ConclusionAll that being said, I've had a lot fun with Convoy. It's a great concept and I'm thrilled that games like this are being made.If you enjoyed FTL and like the idea of that concept being translated to ground vehicles, or if you're a Mad Max junkie and you enjoy tactical roguelikes, you might want to have a look at Convoy.As the bugs aren't game-breaking I have no problem recommending the game, but do keep in mind that you are likely to come across annoying little hiccups here and there. So, if that kind of thing really bothers you, you might want to wait until they're patched out before buying the game.For more reviews, gameplay videos and shenanigans visit  The Roleplay Gamer  YouTube channel.",1

2015,"Being a qualified professional horse trainer is great, but it's not about how much light your horse can shine from its ♥♥♥♥, nor is it about how many races you win, its about how much YOU love your ponies and how much time YOU spend with them. This game is excellent, but before you buy it, I think you should consider the fact that it requires more of your time than a hardcore MMO addiction. It can take weeks to train just one of your horses to it's maximum level, and we all know that you need a lot more than just one horse to beat this game!You might be wondering how I am making these claims with only ~2 hours gameplay time. The truth is, I usually play this game while in Afghanistan on deployment, where I don't have an active internet connection and have to use Steam in offline mode. It's a great game to play with all my mates in the military, and it takes our mind off the horrible war that we are fighting. I highly recommend this to everyone that wants to play the best horse breeding/training sim out there. As I mentioned, it takes up a lot of your time, but in my opinion, it is well worth it!",2

2015,"This is one of those games where the gameplay makes you think and challenges you to excel past areas. But doesn't burden you for making a mistake or dying, there are no lifes, no health and little frustration. This game takes us back to when games were purely fun, not for the sake of a competitive nature or skillful abilities.I remain playing Fez because it's a massive puzzle game that doesn't (or shouldn't) make you feel frustrated about playing it. Diasterpiece's soundtrack helps to make this game a complete immersive world, one in which has a strong cult following for one reason.It's all in all a very great game to play, complete and complete again.",1
2015,"Extremely fast demolition derby meets fast paced and competitive soccer.This game is a complete mashup of two great things, and personally I feel that it comes about better as a whole because of it.  Turbo boost into a enemy player to block them from taking a shot, drive on the walls to bounce the ball closer to a goal or simply jump and tip the ball into the goal.The learning curve also wasn't that steep for a game like this, after a couple matches, I felt right at home.",1
2015,"To say this game game is difficult is like saying the earth is just another rock. This game goes far behind a difficultly controlled simulation where you make tea, who the hell ever thought making tea would be so stressful and infuriating at the same time. Once you get the controls, you would figure it gets easier from there, but it's very likely that your robot-hand will start jittering and fly off and you will fail the mission. Learning the controls are one thing, but mastering this game will definitely take some serious patience.The music is happy and full of energy, but about the time it starts getting difficult.. The music vanishes.. which makes it even more difficult seaming.. Buy this game if you're looking for one  of those simulation challenges.",1

2015,"Devil May Cry 3 seems very classic when compared to DmC Devil May Cry: Definitive Edition (which I'm not to fond of, but that's a different review). Dante is back in his 3rd game in the series, the bosses are fairly difficult, and this game overall is quite a challenge.Which might be because it took me (an experienced DMC fan) over 10 minutes just to figure out all of the buttons. The camera angles feel weird and confining, and as far as I could tell.. unchangeable.3.5/5",1
2015,As i go into my third season everytime i try and play the first game it continues to crash the game. Waste of money and there are so many exploits to get any player you want into your team. Think i will stick to the console nhl games. At least they are playable and don't crash.,1

2015,"Best $3 I've ever spent! This game is a comedic recreation of all those old style RPG's. The dialogue is hilarious, the quotes and references to H.P. Lovecraft (among other stories/myths) are everywhere, and it's cheap! The director's commentary is a great addition as you get a good amount of insight into small parts of development, but these are implemented throughout the game so well that they do not detriment your enjoyment in gameplay, instead,  they actually enhance it.This game is great! Buy it!  :D",1
2015,"This is one of the most intense, emotional, thrilling games I have ever played. It is downright better than the TV series, with characters you actually care for, a great score, really unique art design, choices you make that affect the storyline and of course, many many zombies.

Well when you're faced with terrorists, underground organisations, smugglers, lovers, families, corrput police officers, bribary and many more outlandish situations, a day at work is never, ever dull! Should you sell a digital watch to someone in line to pay for you son's birthday present, or return it to the man who trusted it in your care? Should you be slack with a regular? Should you let someone through the border because a friend asked you to? All of these questions run through your head with evey new person you meet, and all the while, your family back in your apartment are starving, freezing and suffering from sickness...

2015,"With over nine million units sold worldwide, and unprecedented critical acclaim from fans and press around the world, Sid Meier's Civilization is recognized as one of the greatest strategy franchises of all-time. Now, Firaxis Games will take this incredibly fun and addictive strategy game to unprecedented heights by adding new ways to play and win; new tools to manage and expand your civilization; extensive modding capabilities; and intensely competitive multiplayer options. Civilization V will come to life in a beautifully detailed, living world that will elevate the gameplay experience to a whole new level making it a must-have for gamers around the globe! Leprosy is now considered to be a rare disease in Australia; however, eradication of the disease has not been achieved. Globally, rotavirus is the most common cause of severe gastroenteritis in early childhood affecting almost all children under five years of age. A vaccine is now available for infants. Chickenpox is a common viral infection that can reappear later in life as shingles. A vaccine is recommended for all infants and non immune adults. For further information please see factsheet, or contact your local Public Health Unit on 1300 066 055. As a hardcore strategy gamer who is no stranger to planning out my empire's production dozens of turns in advance, I've already turned to Civ V for my world-conquering needs – but at the same time, if anything is going to rear a new generation of strategy gamers like the very first Civilization did for me, it's this. Civilization remains the ultimate pinnacle of the turn based strategy genre. This title introduced some significant changes from earlier civ incarnations, such as a hex-grid and no unit stacking. I believe this caused some lower user reviews amongst players who dislike change. However, I believe the combat tactics were only improved by this, on top of the overall rock-solid strategy and city building aspects of the game. This is Civilization at its best and over time it will ripen like a fine wine and become a masterpiece. 2K Games have outdone themselves in making some massive changes without changing the core gameplay and alienating their fans.",1

2015,"133 hours and i still havent finished it! I will keep trying though! To begin ship selection is restricted to a single vessel but once they're all unlocked through in-game events there is a great selection, each catering to different playstyles. Combat is fast and unforgiving especially if your enemy has an advantage over your craft at that time. Having a level 3 teleporter and 4 mantis boarding crew with stars means nothing if the enemy is a probe with no atmosphere on board. Good micro-management during combat is vital and incredibly satisfying when you pull it off. Fires break out, systems go down and hull breaches appear all of which require crew to manage. There are also environmental factors to consider, like solar flares igniting fires or asteroid fields wrecking your shields. Upgrading your ship is easy and there is so many different upgrades you will be experimenting for a while. Different ships start out with different systems and new systems can be installed in shops throughout the game using the in-game currency: scrap. Highly recommended.",1

Zombie AI just keeps degenerating with every patch. As of writing this review they completely ignore any kind of walls or barriers.

2015,"Let's be honest - a decent turn-based tactical war (with reservations) strategy can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Ambiguous - on the fingers of two hands. On recognized best examples will suffice and one foot Ninja Turtles. All the more regrettable that the best are the most severe ancestors already difficult genre. In those days, X-com: UFO defence forced for years to come to look at the PC as the dominant gaming platform, so how to get on the UFO 1 Playstation1 then was almost unreal, like to know about the console version at all. As part of the promotion of (and cuts in capacity, but this is not always negative) leader is precisely this, the sixth in a row - XCOM: Enemy Unknown. The same replayability and other mechanics of the interaction. I recommend everyone to get acquainted with the best strategy in 2012, and the original 19-year-old, which is superior to the heir in everything except graphics and sound. As for the expansion Enemy Within, it is a mandatory purchase for all fans of the original. Introduction of human groups EXALT resulted in half of new types of missions that will have to be repeated over time in each of the council, but its a fraction of the diversity of these missions are all the same make. It's certainly not the kind of sodomy, which could arrange for the area cultists (and sponsors allies too) in X-com: Apocalypse game at any time at the request of the back heel and when I was a surplus stock of grenades, but no one does. Changing old habits, the use of genetic and technical modifications, new enemies and inventions to deal with them noticeably enliven the battlefield. Several new vnesyuzhetnyh self-contained missions will not get bored in the moments between skeet and EXALTatsiey, but the general outline of the plot remains the same as the ending, and this is another reason not to play in the 2012 version. Advanced remake now absolutely incorrect to compare with the first part - it absoltno self-contained project that seems after a few passages, can complement quantitative indefinitely. More missions, more skills and more things - the absolute predictability from the second approach does not just make nostalgically recall the randomly generated landscapes of the original, but no one does ...",1
2015,"Before us all the power, Majesty and beauty of Ancient Rome, for which it is responsible no less powerful engine Cry Engine! The graphics are simply upside sgibatelna. The movements of the characters live, apparently used motion capture technology. Battles with enemies are realistic and well developed from the point of view of cold weapons. On account of the plot. It is in the style of the movie Gladiator, and several films about Roman legionaries. Of the minuses as I want to note the absence of raschlenenki and too small amount of blood on the screen. Although many people probably display a plus, but not me. Recommend this game to all, I would not dare. Not everyone is like Ancient Rome and fighting with swords. For me personally the game was like back when it was exclusive to the Xbox One. To buy it or not, you decide. From my side I will say that before us is a quality product with excellent graphics and combat system. Game of the year, 10 out of 10. It is time now to do a movie about the Spartans",1

In this MOVA crossed RPG, things characters when we buy are and the characters themselves this race and who we're playing a tank, Archer, mage or warrior chosen by you depending on what race and what class you will be their special abilities in the game. The game also has a dungeon and at the end we will have no turret which is easy to kill, and after tear down line 2 towers (this can help a huge Troll) after break to pichat at the gate there waiting for the boss (he also always pumped as you are) it becomes harder to kill than a normal main turret as in other LANGUAGE games. Daily quests, keys (bronze, silver and gold) for unlocking the race on 1 battle, 1 day, and week, every week give free 3 bronze and 2 silver. The game has a leveling of the character and of our account. And many more all of which I did not see, and only read the description of the game :DFighting 3x3 and 1 map ;( but I think after Closed Beta, at least in the OBT will add cards...The game will appeal to lovers MOVA and fans of RPGs with the top view in the style of Diablo.",1
2015,"This is an excellent game. A first person puzzle solver/thriller.The dark story and in game environment/music/events will more than likely give you goose bumps and you still wont be able to stop playing. It's cheap to purchase and I think it's a must buy for any gamer interested in this genre.The game has some aspects which are not at all obvious and I must admit I fell into the trap of referring to the steam forums for help on a few occaisions. Anyone attempting this game should seek some tips before starting but not spoilers (from someone who has finished it), and give it a red hot go without further help.",1

This game has the standard chose your own upgrades xp system which keeps it interesting.It can feel a bit slow at times, but there's always upgrades to be found and I don't think I have come close to maxing out the speed yet.The game offers a borderlands style mp where friends can join your game.",1

2015,"Interested in seeing some gameplay? see below!https://youtu.be/IwtMIruBpaQTL:DR: If you like sidescrollers, or the ty universe as a whole, definitely pick it up! 8/10 Review Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 4 is the forth installment in the Ty series, this one departs from the original 3D platforming game to a more traditional 2D sidescroller. As a huge fan of the first three games, I was worried about whether this one would hold up, but it smashed my expectations thoroughly!This game manages to take all of the features from the first 3 games and fit them into a sidescroller without feeling forced or out of place. Classic gameplay mechanics such as boomerang gliding and biting your way through flying eggs return as well as collectables such as koala children and thunder eggs! There's a whole host of unlockable boomerangs and costumes to pick up with your opals and every tassy tiger from the game is represented. Pros   Fun sidescrolling gameplay, responsive controls.  Plenty of unlockables  Music similar to the original trilogy.  Large levels with hidden content all over the place.  Environments are interesting and diverse, from the Australian outback, to deep below the sea. Cons   Lots of references to previous games, players new to Ty may get lost at times.  Not a 3D platformer, somewhat disappointing to older fans.  No voice actors, which were a huge part of the original trilogy's appeal. Conclusion Whether you're a seasoned Ty veteran or a newcomer to the series, there's plenty of content in this game to enjoy the graphics and music are reminscent of the original trilogy and the gameplay mechanics are both easy to learn and satisfying to use, definitely pick this game up!8/10",1
2015,"If you want to see some gameplay you can find my first impression video here:http://youtu.be/RIlaQtoLyX0TL;DR: fun game with nice graphics and great music, worth a buy if you're into more stealth and less action. 7/10 Review Master spy is an indie stealth platformer about (mild spoilers)  a spy hired by a corporation to steal a video reel and stop world war 3.  It's a very fun game and has beautiful pixel graphics, the music is great and, for the most part, the controls are tight. Pros   Beautiful pixel graphics  Great soundtrack with fast, energetic tracks to compliment the gameplay.  Simple to learn, hard to master.  No fighting mechanics, all about stealth, puzzles and speed. Cons   While playing with an Xbox 360 controller I had many inputs eaten.  Options menu could be a bit more robust. Conclusion This game is really fun and the difficulty ramps up quite quickly to ensure you don't get bored. The controls are very simple and the gameplay focuses on puzzles over any ""action fighting"" style gameplay, which is a refreshing change from games trying to cram in half baked combat ideas to otherwise wonderful games. The game seems to be a good length for the price and the story is good so far. All in all, definitely worth a buy if you're into more stealth and less action. 7/10",1
2015,"If you want to see some gameplay:https://youtu.be/x8S_1drZnYQEdit: New gameplay video is up and shows more of the game. Review changed a bit below. Review Albino lullaby is an exploration based horror game by Ape Law, in it you play an unnamed character who wakes up in a strange mechanical house and must explore to find out why you're there and what brought you there. Pros   Grapics, are beautiful and interesting, with a style reminiscent of crayon colouring books.  The music is beautiful, at times haunting.  The atmosphere created in this game through the clever use of music and sounds is very creepy and gives a feeling of emptyness throughout gameplay.  The backstory is interesting and very discomforting, the way the story is given through the use of scattered notes as well as environmentally (such as the dentist chair seen in the screenshots above) is very intuitive and to some degree allows players to choose how much story they want to ingest.  Gameplay is simple, the game is easy to pick up and play (double edged sword, see cons.)  No jumpscares! They decided to not take the lazy way out when scaring players.  The weird head things are pretty neat. Cons   Found the game to lag quite a bit after the first play area. (I have a GTX 970 and I7 for reference)  Had issues with recording the game in some areas.  Gameplay is rather simple, meaning some players may easily become bored if they don't enjoy exploring.  When I first played I thought my character was a baby because of a glitch (can be seen in video), also couldn't run.  The game seems to crash if you tab out on the opening cutscene (not a huge issue, just don't tab out until you reach the start menu.) Conclusion This game is very well done in terms of fear factor and atmosphere, the music is beautiful and creepy which adds to the atmosphere of the game as well as giving the player something interesting to listen to. While the gameplay mechanics and puzzles are rather simple, I personally enjoyed the exploration aspect of the game enough that it didn't get boring to play. No jumpscares! not much more needs to be said about that. The story is discomforting and, at times, made me stop playing briefly to digest it, which is how a horror game should be.For content creators, this game can be quite buggy and I found it lagged substantially during recording, so unless you really want to record this game, maybe think about recording a different series.6/10 If you enjoy exploring worlds with a good backstory.5/10 otherwise.Original gameplay video for reference: https://youtu.be/erl0ymSqjmI",1
2015,"Interested in seeing some gameplay? see below!https://youtu.be/PCkK8FAouqATL:DR: If you like some complex logic puzzles then grab this game! 9/10 Review Human Resource Machine is a logic based puzzle game in which you play as a lowly employee of a large corporation slowly rising through the ranks of the company by automating each job. Automation of each job is achieved through the use of simple one line commands which combine to to create a sequential programming language. This game is both a challenging puzzle game and a great way to help new programmers into the world of programming. Pros   Challenging gameplay  Cute story  Replayability in the form of optimizing your code.  Great music and sound, appropriate for the environment.  Super cute graphics. Cons   Only uses sequential programming, where modern programming uses much more object oriented.  Very logic based, definitely not everyones cup of tea for a puzzle game.  While the music is great, there is very little variation in songs, so it can get a little repetitive. Conclusion Whether you're new to the world of programming or a veteran coder this game is fun and offers varying levels of challenge for everyone. The  cute graphics, very ""corporate"" soundtrack and   relatively dark	 storyline all combine to create an amazing little game with a good amount of content for its price. Definitely worth picking up for anyone who enjoys programming or puzzles in general.9/10",1
2015,"To see some gameplay check here:https://youtu.be/_k6dJXBIsrkTL:DR: This is a fun game, but I think it might be a bit expensive for the content given, if you can get it for $5 definitely pick it up, though! 6.5/10 Review My Paper Boat is a cute little game in which you play as a paper boat sailing around different landscapes, environmentally it is incredibly beautiful and the controls are on point for what a paper boat would be. Gameplay wise, there are 3 different game modes, two of which feel very similar, the third, aim mode, is quite unique and really fun. To me, this game is definitely more of a relaxation activity than a full on game. Pros   Beautifully crafted environments that feel very real.  Controls are spot on.  Music is great, ambient sounds are very calming in game.  Levels are very long.  Boat Customization is neat, lots of different options for flags, etc. Cons   Only 3 game modes with 5 maps, can get boring quick.  No sound options in the menu, the sound blasted out my ears when I opened the game.  Coin Collection feels very similar to Rally. Conclusion This game is clearly beautifully crafted with a lot of love, the music and graphics are stunning, the ambient sounds are accurate for the areas, the controls are spot on for how a paper boat would control. Sadly with only 3 game modes, two of which feel very similar and 5 maps, although each map is quite long, the game got boring rather quickly and left me feeling wanting for more to do. I'd love to see a racing mode against AI or even multiplayer? to give far more replayability of an otherwise great game.6.5/10",1
2015,"Interested in seeing some gameplay? see below!https://youtu.be/ooQb1ef_84cTL:DR: Cheap but fun roguelike survival game, some way to go before it's finished, but well worth the price with the current content! 7.5/10 Review Rogue Harvest is a roguelike survival game, with permadeath and gameplay similar to that of hardcore Minecraft or Terraria. In Rogue Harvest you play as the survivor of a plane crash fighting to make sense of and survive in the hostile world in which he's found himself. The gameplay is fun and currently semi-deep, there's several tiers of content for each item (from 2-4 depending on the item) and you are free to create some awesome looking houses to defend yourself with. Pros   Graphically the game is beautiful, enemies look super cool.  Build system is intuitive and fun.  Procedurally generated terrain allows for interesting gameplay between playthroughs Cons   Audio can become repetitive.  Procedural generation can screw you in the early game (I got killed by a high level monster upon spawning in my first world)  Early access can always be a gamble, although this game seems to have a good track record so far. Conclusion Graphics: 8/10The graphics for this game are beautiful, the enemies are varied and interesting to look at, and the buildings look cool when finished.Audio: 7/10The audio is nice at first, and matches the game world well, but feels repetitive and can get annoying after a while.Gameplay: 7.5/10The gameplay is fun and interesting, similar to most games of this genre. There could be more tiers of items, and hopefully more will be added throughout the early access process. I couldn't find much of the story during my playthroughs, but I don't last long and I think I accidentally skip a lot of the dialogue.Overall: 7.5/10The game is enjoyable and interesting, for the low price of $6 I can't see this ever being a bad purchase, there's plenty of content to ingest and the randomly generated worlds keep things interesting.",1

2015,"A lot of fun albeit repetitive. If you're looking to purchase additional warframes for plat, don't. It's far more economical to purchase plat during Steam sales or when you get 75% off during a login reward THEN buy the items you want from other players....or grind your butt off!Nearly everything is available for free however the catch is that you only have a certain number of slots to store your frames and weapons.You can save additional Platinum by getting items from alert missions. D/Ling the WF Alerts app is highly recommended.Also, Loki is amazing. Choose that frame after your tutorial.The Wikia is your Warframe bible. There is theorycrafting and optimal character building in this game and you'll find this reference highly valuable.Complete maps then do nightmare modes for rare dual-stat mods.

2015,"Dishonored is probably one of the most underappreciated  games in my library, which is why I've chosen to write a quick review on it.It has all the aspects of any good game; High quality graphics, captivating soundtrack, in-depth story line and smooth gameplay. Yet I can't help but feel that this game never got the attention it deserves, bar a small buzz following the initial release. Perhaps people felt it was just a mock-up of assasins creed? Because I guess the protagonist mildly resembles Desmond Miles?But Dishonored has you emotionally invested after the first few minutes of cut scenes. The game progresses in saving Emily, the young princess, and overthrowing the corrupt government. Which doesn't take too long after you've been hooked on the game's unique gameplay, versatile powers and lootability. Most people could finish the game in 20 hours, if not 15. But beyond the main storyline is a well designed city, overflowing with intricate details and side quests. Not to mention the game allows you to replay different missions, to give the game a different outcome. Even if one run-through is 15 hours, there are hundreds of hours worth of possibilites .Dishonored is a beautifully constructed game and I recommend it to gamers from any genre; action, adventure, rpg, puzzle etc.",1

2015,"In the festering world of RPGs or gaming in general in which graphics,speedruns that would make Sonic say too fast and unneeded fanservice that would make you grit your teeth in rage rather than entertain you take precedence over everything else, this is what the gaming world needs but not what it deserves. This is my attempt to do a good review and sound not stupid.Characters that are far from stereotypes,supposed accusations of mary-sue that are just actually character devlopment from simply learning from past mistakes(give or take a few tries...) and a world grounded in real world politics and situations while at the same time, a fantastic setting that can keep you entertained and move alongside you.It makes realistic situations part of the charm rather than ditching it like most others,after all there is a good reason why ""reality is stranger than fiction"" is a saying. If you have the patience to read and immerse yourself in an RPG world that defies the usual cliches that came with the genre, than this game is the one for you.P.S:If the wall of text boxes put you off and make you want to skip in a hurry because you want to save,whenever there is dialog stop thinking that you are playing a game but reading a novel.

2015,"This game means so much to me that I cannot really describe it in just words to do it justice.All I can say is I am glad we finally did it guys congrats.Now it is up to the newbies.For me this has been oh so much more than just a long 16 years, oh so much more.Long live Subspace Continuum and all the bests for its future.iyui/AlienC signing out.peace",1

2015,"EDIT: Updated for patch 1.39Patch 1.39 has changed several things. For one, all aircraft are 25% less reserch points. It still takes a long time to unloack all aircraft, but at least they're making some effort to balance the progression curve.1.39 has also massively dropped the price of aircraft (and slightly dropped the price of repairs), in some cases aircraft are 1/3 of the lion price they were. Again, a step in the right direction. Original review content is below, most of the bullet points are the same.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As much as I want to, I can't reccomend this game. Gajin seems to have turned it into a money farm. Progression was always a problem in the game. pre patch 1.37 money was a problem. If you wanted to buy all the aircraft of a rank you had to either grind hard or buy premium currency. It was a constant complaint on the forums. Did Gajin listen? nope!Post patch 1.37 the problem is even worse. Money is still an issue, only now you have to research aircraft individually. Other members have done the math on this showing that it slows progression and devalues premium currency by 4-5x. The progression curve is broken. So broken that it's kind of pointless to switch between countries. if you want a jet before your 60th birthday, you grind the hell out of one country until your brain melts.This saddens me. The game itself is wonderfully fun. The way the devs have handled it makes me want to puke. If you do play, play for free. Don't give them your money like I did.",1
2015,"There is very little not to love about this game. The vanilla content is finished to an amazing level of polish. The physics are on-point in almost every car. Slides are catchable. You can feel the tyre wall flex when you approach the limit. You can feel the front end push and the back end skate around more than any sim I've ever played. The FFB in this game is different to any other game on the market right now. For the first few hours the wheel felt dead to me because you only recieve the forces that would be translated to the wheel in the actual car, not a bunch of canned effects as well. With a T500 the FFB is exact, and a pleasure to drive with once you get used to it. Seriously if you don't own this game and you like sims, buy this now. and there's a laser scanned nordschleife now. What's not to love?Beyond the devs there are truly incredible mods from the community. I would strongly reccomend the T5 (DTM) cars from united racing design. They're like the best sim cars I've ever driven and are well worth the price of admission. There's millions of other great mods though, look on race department and you will find what you desire.There are some areas that are lacking in my opinion. For example, there are no pit stops or longer races, the career system is pretty lackluster, the AI still does some weird things and the visual damage modeling is not quite up to scratch yet. Overall though, this game is worth every single cent and then some",1
2015,"While i do love this game, it is not without issues.The primary issue is the multiplayer. I greatly anticipated playing classic AOE 2 with modern netcode, but apparently that was not to be. If Skybox fix the multiplayer issues I would happily reccomend this to anybody that would listen.",1

2014,"This is not a Metal Gear Solid game.This is just another generic brown dude-shooter.Of what I've played so far it is easily the worst MGS game story wise. I havent played many other MGS games admittedly (only Snake Eater and Peace Walker, and Gound Zeros I suppose. All the others I watched on Youtube). This is just such a disappointment, it's not neccasarily a bad game, but it was no where near my very high expections. The real problem is, I can't quite put my finger on what exactly I don't like about this game (apart from the ""story""). There are few things though, like Big Bosses voice actor (can't remember his name), he barely says anything, I just find myself begging him to actually talk, and when he does I wish he would stop, the character just seems like another generic action-game protaganist. Its just disappointing.I'll still be playing this game simply because I feel obliged, but I won't be enjoying it nearly as much as I had hoped.

2015,"First of all, this game gave me cancer. Not like, haha funny cancer, but actual cancer. I spent most of the early hours of this game running through radiated areas completely naked, with nothing but a few fire sticks and my trusty rock named Wilson.The aim of the game is to not get rust on any of your metal items. The easy part about this is that WIlson is made of stone, so you're practically unstoppable. You spend a large portion of the game cutting down trees and killing animals, because f**k greenpeace. Eventually you build a house out of twigs, mud and tears only to have it blown to bits by a**hats with C4. When you leave the game, you do not actually leave, you simply go into an induced coma where you dream of real life, only to wake up back in the land of rust where some 12 year old has kicked down your door, violated your comatosed body and taken you for everything you have. The moral of the game is to always sign a prenup. 3/10, would more than likely not dine again - IGN",1
2015,"7 Days To Die is one of the easiest games I have ever played. I am not sure why the standard is set so low. Even on my slowest play through, it only ever took me 2 days to die. Game is too easy, please fix.In all seriousness, this game was pretty bad ♥♥♥. It took me a couple of attemps to not be ♥♥♥♥ at the game, but by my third or fourth death, I started to learn that dogs are the most evilist ♥♥♥♥ out there and to avoid at all costs. After making it past that slight learning curve, the game got pretty simple. The single player gameplay essentially goes like this. Day time: Gather resources for eating, drinking and building. Build structures or fortify a pre-built house.Night time: Stay inside your house. Cry. Pray for morning. Pray extra hard every 7th night. (Once you have overcome the fear of falling off the roof, you will be able to start raining death from above).Morning: Fix your house, because zombies are disrespectful af and break all of your stuff.REPEAT.",1

2015,"This game...nothing else to say other than I'm blown away by the amazing amount of talent shown by the developer. That is correct, one man did everything. Art, music, game play, everything, and it shows. But in a way that speaks on a very personal level.Armed with Wings: Rearmed takes me back to the old days of trawling Newgrounds for the next bite of entertainment to while away those 'computer education' classes back in high school. It's an undiluted experience that doesn't hold your hand, giving a steadily increasing challange that while initially frustrating, pushes you to learn its nuances.I wont go into much game play detail as I feel this will ruin the experience, suffice to say it's a side-scrolling, combo driven slasher with the occasional puzzle thrown in for good measure. Oh and an upgrade system which only served to make me play more, I need that next sword!Three thumbs up mate, cheers for the chat at PAXAUS 2015, I was the guy you asked if I was a developer and the answer was no.

I also noticed other spells not actually having their effect trigger occasionally when they should. The spell Random was particularly bad for this, with AI opponents it was used on not even rolling for the effect sometimes (seems to be a problem particularly when someone is on the Crown of Command).The interface in this game needs work (sometimes you don't know what spell you're currently casting, or what type of card it wants you to select from where).It's generally pretty fun, but I simply can't play it while it doesn't abide by its own rules.",1

If they wanted to do that they should've tied it to how many bosses have been defeated, or titles earned or something.

Game looks very refined already, can't wait to see the improvements as they go along. Will love to see how they continue to add content to the game, would love to see bigger islands with proper forests and things like that. Hopefully implement other boats or NPCs or something like that too. But if you want to just waste time this game so far is excellent for that purpose. See how long you can survive, what kind of salvage items you can find. The flippers and goggles make swimming a lot easier for instance.

2015,"This game is quite fun. It's a 2D Top-Down Space Shooter set in the upper atmosphere; as such, you need to deal with manuverability via thrusters, but aerodynamics are still a factor. The game itself is enjoyable, but the real fun comes into the ship building aspect; there are many different ship types, weapons, gear, software and armour to choose from. Want rotating turrets? You can have that. Want to attach yourself to enemy ships so that you can destroy them close up? It's possible.The only real downside is the leveling system; it takes a while to level up (which is the only way to get new parts.) There is also a budget system, which limits how much you can put on it (ship space can also be an issue.)) You increase your budget by killing people in explosive fashion.They could fix this in my opinion by making it easier to level up or simply removing the leveling system and retaining only the budget system, but that's just me.Overall, the game is very much worth more than the asking price.

2015,"The more you play it, the more you'll come to like it. It's a great game/sim for those interested as to how x scenario may go down in the real world or for those who simply want to play a simulator involving air and naval combat from a commanders point of view. (Ground based combat is pretty crude and feels like its there just for the sake of been there)At first when you load up a scenario/mission, you'll just stuff around and work out how to do what and when and why. Maybe pop open your browser in the middle of it a couple of times and search the forums to figure some things out, but if you persist you'll find its an enjoyable experience even if your not heavily into simulators of this sort, simply due to the depth and vairability the same scenario can have even with slightest of vairations in your actions. 1 scenario can play out 100 different ways. You can play it for an hour and only feel like 5 or 10 minutes have passed. If you want a game you can play when its raining outside and the internet is down (as is often the case for myself), or when you've simply got time to spare and want to play a game that is something different this will hit the spot. :)",1

Llega un punto que es solo avanzar, deberia haber algun especimen que te venga de frente y no solo de atras.La variedad de habitaciones. No vendria mal que agreguen unas cuantas mas ya que se hacen repetitivas ",1

2015,"Great game, thoroughly enjoyed it!",1
2015,"There is nothing bad to say about this game. Nothing.The soundtrack is a unique, atmospheric montage of skillfully crafted musical sounds. The gameplay is flawless and exciting, and can be quite the challenge to those who think they've seen all the game has to offer! With an intricate overworld, gorgeous scenery, and riveting gameplay, this is a must-have game for anyone who enjoys platformers or video games in general.There are hidden spots in every level where you can sit and enjoy the scenery for as long as you like, all while relaxing to the fabulous soundtrack. There are hidden secrets which add to the game's depth as you struggle to find at least one in every level of every one of the four worlds. For an indie game, it does everything right.The controls are responsive and they will not miss an input unless you put in a dash while you're in the air (as that won't happen on any game anyways). Each level is better than the last, and there's a Tome of Levels for you to visit your favorites if you choose not to run through the overworld to get to it. Please play it with a controller, as keyboard takes getting used to.All in all, this game is wonderful. For me personally not worth 10 bucks or whatever it goes for, but you can get it every few months in a bundle for a dollar with some other games, so there's always that.",1
2015,"If you like hidden object games this one at least has a plot. Artwork is very pretty, Map feature makes this an easy one to work around. Typical bizarre plot about the ghost of a pirate that kidnaps a young girl to substitute for his long lost and ghostly lost love. The player is the girls mother and you have to rescue her. There is an extension to the game to get home. Inexpensive good first or second game for someone who's yet to experience true classics like the Syberia series, or perhaps some older DOS games like GABRIEL KNIGHT! That's that stuff I like.3.5/5, not the best in its genre, but great for kids. UI takes a bit of getting used to.",1

If you want to play it without frame drops, you need to adjust the graphics so it looks even worse than Arma 2 lol. What does this game think it is, Crysis? Are we supposed to wait till 2019 to be able to play it? Maybe they'll release a DLC that fixes this instead of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ go-karts. Here's a point of reference: GTA V runs on ultra settings, everything maxed out and I never drop below 50-60fps.",1
2015,"Really wish I bought the mod for arma II instead. Granted it's in alpha, the cost is unjustified, it's been out for a while now and the rarity of updates suggests this thing is nothing more than a milking off of the mod's popularity. I've had issues from literally the main menu, involving my DPI res & mouse.

Yes the graphics aren't impressive, but the atmosphere & magic is what makes it iconic, so get over it!I'm not going to give it a thumbs down because it's keeping the franchise alive (whether that's good or bad is another story).

2015,In most games a boss fight involves killing a single boss. In Shadow of Mordor the boss fights are about getting killed by eight bosses at once.,1
2015,"For me the fun in playing Fallout 4 has been about the brief moments in between all the other stuff, sure a lot of the game is going to one location or other and killing loads of the same enemies over and over, then fetching misc_item01 and returning it to the quest giver, but the typically rather bland combat and quests are punctuated by incredible moments of joy, wonder and exploration. I still haven't finished the main quest, but it's already engaged me in a way that no other Bethesda game hasUnfortunately Fallout 4 still has a lot of the issues other Bethesda titles have suffered from like bugginess, random crashes, frame rate drops, insufficient tutorialisation, and moments of bad writing and/or voice acting. The good news is that all the stuff Bethesda are great at like character customisation and progression, world building, and of course the construction of hundreds if not thousands of mininarratives across the world have all been done exceptionally well here.The settlement system is fun but could certainly have used more attention. There's very little explanation of how it works and some obvious and painful limitations to it (which of course make me all the more eager for the creation kit's release). The stringent no-clipping rules are a pain, as is being unable to turn off automatic snapping, and time and again I find myself wanting to build objects which exist everywhere in the wasteland but can't be built in settlements (campfires for instance).Bethesda needs to improve in not releasing broken unpolished games, but in playing it I've found it hard to point out situations where cutting a feature, location, quest, etc and spending the equivalent resources on bugtesting would result in a better game.Edit: Probably should have mentioned, I'm not a fan of the dialogue system's ""press right to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, press down to be that kid in class who sucked up to the teacher, press left for wildcard? usually a sarcastic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though."" Not only does it suffer from the classic Mass Effect problem of not really knowing what your character is actually going to say, but it's taken out room for SPECIAL checks other than the charisma one. Getting access to different dialogue options based on your strength, intelligence, etc. were one of my favourite things of FO3 and NV.",1

I have seen the updates and the progress, adding new content, improving gameplay and twecking features. Overall I've been happy, but this game is dying. The one thing that has cut the last straw is that fact that i have to wait 15-20 minutes to join a game that doesnt last no longer than 60 seconds, and I'm not over reacting, after wasting my time, on average a game lasts no longer than 60 seconds. Cause of this constant long time consumption, i have now uninstalled this game as the developers are too worried about releasing new content instead of fixing numerous problems. Maybe we'll see, in the future if they decide to fix it, ill re-install it again and play again with mates. But it's not just me, its a large majority who have the same problem.",1

I dont understand how its got so many bad reviews Ive played for 60+ hours at the time of writing this and have not experienced a single crash.. Im guessing their trying to run this game on a potato..The only flaw i have found while playing is that it only has 3 server regions. EU, NA and RU. So if you're like me and live in Australia or Oceania you will have really high ping.. Ive actually spoken to an admin about this ingame and they told me more servers are in the works. So dont believe the reviews saying its unfair or unbalanced.. this is a game where skill matters.I'm able to play this game with 200-400 ping with out spending a cent and still place top 3 in matches..Do not play this game like CoD it will get you killed quickly.. Never peak around the same corner twice.. if you think another player has spotted you FLANK THEM!! Always try to trick your enemy.. If you try to run and gun you will fail quickly.. It obviously not a triple A title with a massive budget but what they have created is honestly something special. Play it with mates and you will fall inlove with the large maps and atmosphere.  ",1

2015,"This game, though it looked worse than Half-Life 2 (which was released in 2004), used to be fun and used to have a reasonable business model.Overtime, hundreds of DLC was, and still is, getting pumped out, at slow intervals and at increasingly poor quality. The rebalancing of the old weapons system and the introduction of microtransactions was the last straw for me, where you now have to PAY for decent weapons with real cash, whereas before you could do a mighty fine job with the guns that came default with the game. Not only that, you aren't even guaranteed to get a decent gun even if you pay thanks to the ""gambling"" system that is designed to milk you out of your hardearned dollar.Not to mention that some usermade mods were INTENTIONALLY broken. Hours of work from people dedicated to this game ruined because of the microtransactions update.This game is literally the definition of anti-consumer.

2015,Nie polecam.Przez tą grę można dostać choroby psychicznej.Więcej nerwów niż radości z gry. Bardzo irytująca (subiektywna opinia).Aczkolwiek pomysł na grę jest pierwszorzędny.Można zagrać i się przekonać. Ja wychodzę.,1
2015,"Świetna gra! Mimo, iż jest ciągle w fazie alfa daje bardzo dużo zabawy.Aktualna alfa (22) w trybie kampanii posiada tylko jedną misję, która jest swojego rodzaju tutorialem wprowadzającym w realia gry. Po ukończeniu tej misji możemy albo kontynuować wcześniej przygotowane więzienie albo zacząć od zera projektować własne.Kampania w tej grze na pewno będzie miłym dodatkiem, jednak największa frajda jest poprzez stworzenie własnego więzienia od zera. Mam absolutną władzę nad tym w jaki sposób będziemy postępować z więźniami. Przykładowo możemy stworzyć więzienie, które będzie więzieniem idealnym, gdzie każdy więzień ma własną celę i dodatkowo może przystąpić do programów resocjalizacji. Natomiast kompletnie z drugiej strony możemy zrobić więzienie niczym nazistowski obóz pracy czy gułag, gdzie więźniowie cały dzień będą pracować, a my będziemy uzbrajać strażników po zęby, żeby żaden więzień nie odważył się powiedzieć czegokolwiek, że mu się nie podoba.Możliwości jest multum.Oczywiście istnieją wymogi dla których możemy dane więzienie ""przegrać"" np. poprzez bankructwo.Najlepsze w tej grze jest oczekiwanie na nowe możliwości, gdyż developerzy co miesiąc przygotowują kolejną wersję gry.W tym momencie należy brać pod uwagę, że gra jest w trakcie alfy, co oczywiście oznacza błędy w grze, ale z większością z nich da się żyć.",1
2015,"Jedne z najlepszych wyścigówek w jakie przyszło mi grać ze znajomymi online multi.Gra bardzo przypomina Mario Kart, jeśli ktoś miał okazję grać.Co wyróżnia znacząco te wyścigi od innych to słowo ""Transformed"" - każda postać ma 3 tryby ""jazdy"": na ziemi, na wodze i w powietrzu.Poprzez te 3 tryby techniki ""jazdy"" znacząco się zmieniają, co bardzo fajnie wpływa na możliwości zdobycia prowadzenia w wyścigu.Trasy są wszystkie bardzo fajne, kolorowe, zróżnicowane, np. niektóre nie mają latania w ogóle, a niektóre mają prawie tylko i wyłącznie latanie. Trasy potrafią się też zmieniać w zależności od danego okrążenia np. część trasy może ulec zniszczeniu i przy kolejnym okrążeniu jedziemy już inną drogą, która została odblokowana albo, co jest jeszcze lepsze, przelatujemy w trybie samolotu nad całą wcześniej zniszczoną trasą.Tak samo jak w Mario Kart mamy możliwość znajdywania na trasie różnego rodzaju bonusów jak np. rakiety czy boostery. Skutecznie możemy sobie ułatwić zwycięstwo albo utrudnić je przeciwnikowi.Najlepszy smaczek tej gry jest z grania ze znajomymi na multi. Polecam w 100%.",1
2015,"W grze wcielamy się w postać urzędnika imigracyjnego na granicy fikcyjnego kraju Arstotzka.Celem każdego dnia w tej grze jest sprawdzanie dokumentów imigrantów, następnie albo pozwalamy im przekroczyć granicę albo oddalamy ich z niczym.Fabuła gry jest bardzo dopracowana i (jeśli mnie pamięć nie myli) przewiduje 20 różnych zakończeń gry w zależności od naszych poczynań w jej trakcie.Żeby zdobyć wszystkie acziwy tej gry musimy ją przejść niemal dosłownie 20 razy - za Ntym razem może się to wydawać bardzo monotonne, gdyż niektórzy imigranci zostają zawsze ci sami i trzeba ich ""obsługiwać"" dokładnie w ten sam sposób.Gra jest bardzo fajna jeśli przechodzi się ją raz. Natomiast przechodzenie jej 20 razy dla wszystkich acziwów jest już tylko dla prawdziwych hardkorów, którym monotonia tej gry nie będzie zbytnio przeszkadzać.Jako całość oceniam na plus - warto zagrać.",1
2015,"Chciałem w tą grę zagrać tylko chwilę. Skończyło się tak, że jak się złapie rytm gry to już ciężko przestać.W grze chodzi o to, żeby przekładać kryształy w taki sposób, żeby przynajmniej 3 były obok siebie. Po pewnym czasie można nabrać wprawy i przekładać kryształy tak, aby układać spore combo.Gra jest na tyle prosta i fajna, że można się uzależnić i wpaść w wir przekładania - należy uważać.Granie myszką na PC jest średnie, osobiście wolałbym grać paluchami na tablecie.Generalnie polecam, bardzo fajna gra, żeby się rozluźnić, typowy casual.",1
2015,"Pierwsza gra z serii mangi/anime ""Naruto"", która wyszła na PC.Wcześniej grałem w wiele innych odsłon tej serii na konsolach.Ta część pokrywa fabułę mangi z okolicy Wojny Ninja, gdzie musimy zmierzyć się z Madarą.Gra jest praktycznie idealnym portem z konsoli Xbox 360, więc granie (możliwe) na klawiaturze w moim odczuciu mija się z celem i należy używać pada (jakiegokolwiek, ale najlepiej tego z X360).Kupiłem ją, żeby przejść całą część fabularną. Tok gry można podzielić na 3 części: open world, w którym prowadzimy interakcję z różnymi NPC i możemy wykonywać poboczne misje; walki, których jest masakrycznie dużo i nie są one tylko z bossami czy jakimiś głównymi postaciami, lecz nawet z jakimiś pomniejszymi NPC, które są tylko po to, żeby poprzeszkadzać; cutscenki, grałem w wiele gier opartych na mandze/anime, ale cutscenki w tej grze są pierwszorzędne jakościowo (na potrzeby wersji PC zostały użyte lepsze tekstury niż na konsoli), podobnie jak w nowszych grach z serii Final Fantasy cutscenki są na tyle dobrze dopracowane, że ciężko je skipować, gdyż bardzo dobrze się je ogląda.Polecam gorąco tylko osobom, które znajdują się w uniwersum Naruto. Granie bez znajomości mangi/anime chociaż w części mija się kompletnie z celem.",1
2015,"Przygodówka typu Point'n-Click.Naszym zadaniem jest znalezienie skradzionego misia w magicznym świecie z szafy.Gra jest pełna różnych łamigłówek i trzeba trochę pomyśleć, żeby ją całą przejść.Przechodzi się ją 2x i w czasie tych dwóch przejść da się zdobyć wszystkie acziwy.Bardzo fajna jak na machnięcie na raz.",1
2015,"W dwóch słowach - gorąco polecam.Symulator kozy, który tak na prawdę został stworzony ""dla jaj"", ale mimo wszystko można mieć dużo frajdy z samej gry.Kupiłem ją w dniu premiery na Steamie (1 kwietnia 2014). Początkowo była dostępna tylko jedna mapa, ale po wprowadzeniu niedawno patcha 1.1 dostępne są 2 mapy.Każda z map ma własne questy, które wykonujemy poprzez robienie rozmaitych rzeczy jako koza. Dodatkowo do tego mamy acziwy na Steamie, przy czym niektóre są dość trudne do zrobienia (np. Flappy Goat z którego developerzy żartują przy okazji każdego nowego patcha).Jedyne czego mi bardzo brakuje w tej grze to online multiplayer. Z patchem 1.1 wprowadzili tylko splitscreen multi dla 4 osób.Czekam na kolejne patche dodające nowy content i na online multi.Baaa~",1
2015,"Recenzja alfy!Już dawno nie przyszło mi grać w tak wciągającego FPSa.W grze wcielamy się w jedną z 4 postaci, które polują na potwora bądź w samego potwora, którego zadaniem jest albo zabić wszystkich ""hunterów"" albo rozwalić ""power relay"". Jako potwór nie grałem, więc ta recenzja jest bazowana tylko na kilkudziesięciu meczach jako polujący.W alfie dostępne są 3 mapy, 4 typy polujących i 2 powtory. Aby odblokować więcej polujących i drugiego potwora najpierw trzeba zrobić kilka osiągnięć - generalnie polegają one na używaniu umiejętności danej postaci.Każdy typ postaci ma ściśle określoną rolę w czasie polowania:Assault - główny ""damage dealer"" drużyny polujących,Trapper - specjalizuje się w środkach przytrzymywania potwora,Medic - jak nazwa wskazuje,Support - ochrania innych przed atakami potwora.Potwór ma 3 różne poziomy ewolucji w czasie gry. Zaczyna na 1. i stopniowo podczas pożerania dziczy na mapie zdobywa kolejne. Najlepszym wyjściem jest złapać w klatkę potwora na 1. poziomie i ubić go jak najszybciej. Niestety większość gier tak nie wygląda, gdyż potworem gra jakaś osoba, a nie komputer, więc można się spodziewać, że potwór będzie z samego początku jak najbardziej unikać polujących, a dopiero jak się nażre to zacznie walczyć ze swoimi przeciwnikami dobrowolnie.Gra się bardzo przyjemnie: cele są jasno określone, sterowanie banalne i intuicyjne, opcjonalne tutoriale ukryte są w czasie wczytywania gry, więc nie marnujemy na nie czasu w ogóle, poziom zawodników jest dobierany sensownie.Evolve jest tym typem gry w którym znajdzie się i osoba, która lubi granie zespołowe, jak i osoba, która bardzie gustuje w grach typu single player.Gorąco polecam i czekam na bete (zapewne będzie więcej ciekawych rzeczy dodanych).",1

2015,"A nice Roman-themed little city builder, It's a great choice for anyone who enjoyed games like Caesar III, Pharaoh, or the Tropico games. Similar scale of cities, with good enough graphics to be pretty and good enough depth in the city-building to provide strategic depth. I've found it to be stable and smooth on a wide range of computers, from low-powered laptops to high-end rigs, so it's also a good game for travelling with.The biggest challenge in the game is the city building rather than the combat, it's more a city simulator than a wargame (again, like Caesar or Pharaoh). ",2
2011,"A groundbreaking experience in freedom and flexibility. A true sandbox of pseudo-medieval pseudo-Europe, with no overarching story except what you make for yourself. Want to lead a maruding party of raiders? Go for it. Want to make money hauling goods from one city to another? Go for it. Want to found your own kingdom or help a claimant retake their throne? Among the many things M&B:W gets right is the actual combat. The graphics may be a little clunky, the AI is not as sophisticated as it could be, but the visceral crunch of your lance into an enemy as you charge them down is one of the most satisfying combat moments of gaming.",2

2015,"This is such as good game. The game world is so huge, it would probably take 30 min to travel across the map BY PLANE! The game world is equivalent of a state or a small island nation, and it's a very well developed nation, so it has all the things you think you can find in a well developed nation. Big cities, towns and villages, factories, military bases, and more. The game has an engaging main story line and lots of side missions.",1
2015,"This game is a combination of city building, tactical combat, and economy simulation. Some people may think it's jack of all trades, but the end user experience is very involved and very fun and rewarding to play. You really get your money worth with this game. You can design your city layout, design supply chain and trade route, use all kind of cool tech like EMP bomb to conduct warfare. This game is simply the best. The problems with the game are the newbie learning curve is very steep and you need a decent computer if you want to play smoothly on the biggest map with lots of AI players.",1
2014,"Black ops IMO is the best COD game since the original COD. It's great fun to play and Black Ops 2 is such an improvement over Black Ops 1, it's worth the money.",1
2015,"Max Payne 3 is a great game. The game consists of a story mode, an arcade mode, and multiplayer mode. All three are fully functional and offer different gameplay experiences. The story mode is about 10-12 hours of gameplay, it has nice cutscenes to streamline the loadings and puts players in a variety of locales with stunning detailed visuals. The arcade mode allows players to play through each part of the story mode separately to gain maximum scores or minimum time. The scores are recorded on the server for comparison. I only played team deathmatch in multiplayer, it's no call of duty or battlefield,  but it has its own unique features which makes it really fun.  Problem I have with the game is on one occasion the game failed to load and I had to do an ""End Task"" in windows. The story is pretty boring and there are slightly too many cutscenes. All over I would give the game a 8/10.",1

2015,"tl:drScore 7.2/10Pros:- Smooth animations- environment is nice to look at- a nice amount of builds to try out- doesn't feel like a grindCons:- barely any end game- items are not impactful- story is generic and bland during some areasTorchlight 2 is a fast-paced action multiplayer role playing game, similar to diablo 3. It has a colourful art style with smooth animations and 'click to move' movement. Torchlight 2 greatly improves on its predecessor Torchlight 1 through more gameplay options and content however still has some problems such as the lack of endgame due to the improved but still few build paths. In Torchlight 2, the aim is to stop 'the alchemist' from taking over the land in which you must complete a series of 'acts' which all include a large amount of dungeons and maps which are randomnly generated. The story however will only take a few hours to complete on easy difficulty but will be increasingly challenging the higher the difficulty. After you complete the story you are given the option to replay it at a higher difficulty or enter the 'clockwork' which is like a HUB where you choose various dungeons to clear and recieve rarer and stronger loot to upgrade your character. Overall the story is interesting and gives a sense of urgency to the player and will provide entertainment for a couple of hours until you complete it.However in Torchlight 2 the story is not its main focus, but rather its combat and rewards for completing dungeons. Torchlights combat is smooth, flashy and makes grinding fun due to its fast-paces and simple design. 3 Skills builds exist for all classes in which you can only undo up to your 5th choice making choosing your skills an important decision. Stat build also exist which improve your general strength. Rewards are recieved by killing monsters  which will drop gold, potions and items. Items come in various rarities with rarer items being stronger which you can upgrade by inserting gems (also dropped by monsters). The mentioned drops can also be found in chests found across the maps. In total the combat system is great and but lacks variety and the items dropped dont have much of a power up feel.Overall Torchlight 2 is a fun game to play while it lasts due to its great combat and beautiful artstyle. This is also supported by its multiplayer compatability and various skill options allowing for customisation of your character. This however does not last long due to its lacklustre end game which grows full and boring relatively quickly (yes, there are mods available but even they dont last very long and gameplay is in all intents and purposes the same). This leads to the final score for this game which is a 7.2/10 and can improve by increase end game content, more variety in skills and classes and more impactful drops",1
2015,"tl:drScore: 7/10Pros:- smooth and colourful- easy to learn but challenging to master- cheap- still being improved- quick matches make sit easy to fit in schedulesCons:- lacks content still- will start to get repetitive- no real reason to play rankedSpeed runners is an indie developed, 2D sidescrolling, racing game that is fit for all ages due to its unique appearance, availability and 'quick to pick-up' controls. This combined with its fast paced gameplay and short game length allows it to be played anywhere and anytime (i myself am guilty of sneaking it in and about while doing homework and assignments,""just 1 more match!"") which can explain its overwhelmingly positive feedback even while it is still in 'Beta' development. Included with this gameplay is the intergration of the ranking system which involves the use of the leaderboard which tracks players in you league and how many points they have which allows the player to check their standings compared to others which allows for a competitive environment that increase the games longegevity and also seperates casual players to more serious ones.Speed runners appearance is fit for all ages due to its bright and bold colour palette which distinguishes the background from the runners that the players control, giving the game a 'quirky' and fun feeling. Its availability comes from its low price of 10 dollars while not on sale and 2 dollars while on sale which is a cheap price compared to most other games in the market that usually range from 15 to 25 dollars. Speed runners is also a 'quick to pick-up' game letting players get into the game faster and also making it less daunting for newer players to the genre. This combined with its cheap price and colourful appearance sets this game up for long-term success due to its wide target market and the fact that cartoons are better than realism long-term due to realism always being outdated while cartoons itself are a unique and personalize genre of presentation.Its rank system involves the use of leagues which are different groups that players are placed in due to their skill. Its uses a point system which is the way you rank up to a higher league in Speed Runners in which points are earned according to you succes in matches. However you may ask how they balance out the points lost or gained if you in a match with higher ranked people? Speed Runners makes it so that if your vsing a higher ranked person, the points you lose in the match are decreased and if you vsing a lower rank person, the points you lose are increased. This, combined with the quick matches that speed runners offer makes the ranking environment, friendly and less daunting for any player. There are the reasons why Speed Runners in my opinion is worthy of a 7/10 rating which can be improved through increased content, different styles of gameplay e.g. new gamemodes, perhaps a unique character customisation (might be going a bit too far xD) and general bug fixes which i strongly believe will be achieved when this game is out on full release (maybe not the character customization).",1

SIDENOTE: IT DOESN'T LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN A 5 DOLLAR GAME TBH AND AT TIMES SEEMS TO PLAY LIKE ONE AS WELL BUT I'M HOPING THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED IN COMING UPDATES. BUT IT CERTAINTLY PLAYS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED IT AND I AM GLAD I GOT IT FOR $15.99.",1

2015,"Its an alright game I guess, its more realistic but the gameplay is bad, the maps arent too good and extinction mode is way too hard. The only good thing about this game is the campaign, its better than all the other cods campaigns.If you want a game just for the campaign and single player, definatly get this but if you want it for the online get black ops 2 or Modern Warefare 3. Personally I'd give it a rating of 4.5/10.",1

I don't walk up stairs and receive a black screen and watch the all too familiar words ""You are dead"" phase onto the screen. A good step in the right direction by the devs. If it continues like this and fulfills its potential, giving us an immersive, post-apocalyptic survival game we were promised then the game will be incredible. Though I still can't recommend it due to the high price tag for an unfinished game that will remain unfinished for a very, very long time and sadly even on sales it is still rather high.",1
2015,great for people willing to put time into mastering its tools.,1

2015,"Risk of rain is a game deserves to be in your steam library.This game revolves around the items you find which can impact your overall gameplay. Would you be a ballistic man spewing rockets and mortar non-stop or would you assemble a drone army? This depends on your luck. The spawn items are random which makes the game have a high replay value. Having the right items can make you feel like a god as you see boss after boss fall before you.The music itself is very unique and fits the game very well and I commend Chris Christodoulou for giving the game so much life. The artstyle may be a turn-off for people who do not appreciate 8-bit graphics. However, it appeals to me particularly the Imp Overlord and the monster logs of each creature you can encounter in the game as such a simple art can be so unique.However this game like anything has its drawbacks. After a certain amount of time collecting the right items combination, it is more of a test of patience instead of a test of endurance. At a certain point you would feel your items and your drones are carrying you into the battle instead of you. Some may find the game a little bit brutal particularly during the boss or the late game as they spawn relentlessly but it may appeal to you as it gives you difficulty and challenge.9.99$ for this game? A steal i must say.",1

2015,"An interesting game. No UI, not a single word in English, super simple controls, and yet, it tells a really good story about the struggle of 2 brothers (lel) in a fantasy world.

2015,A lighthearted rogue-lite turn based tactic game. It's very good at what it does and with a simple yet deep rock paper scissors combat. It has excellent replayability thanks to the different approaches and play styles you can try. I'd recommend it to anyone into strategy games.,2

2015,"So its only in open beta at the moment, but its a real solid game right now. Sort of what TF2 would be if TF2 wasnt such a muck around game. Its hella fast paced - movement speed is really high for all classes, and you can wall jump and stuff - and mostly balanced. There are minor balance issues but the game is constantly being updated and as such the game is generally getting more balanced with each patch. The company behind this game seems to quite involved with the community as well, and is constantly adding and trialling new content which is nice. My only really gripe is its pay model. Like most free to play fps games, you have the option of buying sidegrades with both real and in-game currency. Each Merc (class) costs a ludicrous amount of in-game currency, either 30k or 50k credits, where you seldom get 1k per match. While I really enjoy grinding for things in game, this just seems a tad excessive given there are other things you can spend your credits on. It just makes me feel like to get the most out of this game I have to invest actual money into it. It's just something that irks me but I totally understand why its in the game and its not a particularly terrible thin, considering the game is every bit as playable with 2 mercs as it is with 10.All in all, a great fps that is the right combination of competitive and fun.",1

Also, if you don't have a mid to high tier PC your not going to enjoy this game as much. I'm running a 780ti, 16gbs RAM and a overclocked CPU and 4.8GHZ and occasionally the frames stutter.

2015,"I am in love with this game. For once a story that actually makes you think, that poses difficult questions about our world and the direction it is headed. The story and gameplay complement each other, too, you couldn't have one without the other. i found the gameplay itself to be pretty fun and I like how you can make your own combos to suit your fighting style or the tactis of a particular fight. Also being able to heal from landing a combo is great - even if a fight is going badly, you are never completey out because you can be careful and land some healing combos to make a comeback.The setting is captivating and the voice acting and characterisation are good. I really identified with Nilin and I liked the moral uncertainties the game presents to you. Also, having been to Paris, it was fun seeing places I recognised transformed into a cyberpunk future. This game is very evocative and if the premise sounds interesting to you, you should definitely try it out!",1

There were no australian servers so the lagg is insane, it literally takes 0.5-1 second(s) to simply start the timer to loot something absolute bs.-bows and arrows: if you are going to make guns rare, altleast make the bows viable, the arrows drops like it is made of f***ing lead like wtf.

2015,"Half-Life 2 was created by Valve in 2004 and still holds up, ten years later. You play as Gordon Freeman, a scientist with a shotgun and a gravity gun! The graphics aren't fantastic by today's standards but you can imagine how great they would have been upon the 2004 release. You get control of a diverse range of weapons and vehicles, facing countless different enemies, from zombies to trigger happy law enforcers. Set in a dystopian world, the game has huge variation in level design and crushing combine soldeirs with a huge metal crate lifted by a magnetised crane never gets old. One of the best things however, is the awesome physics engine this game has to offer. You can use your gravity gun to move objects around you, often rewarding you with the satisfaction of firing a metal disc to take a zombie's head off. This game can be found on the steam store for cheap and will be well worth your money. I say bring on Half-Life 3!",1
2015,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood isn't a whole lot different than it's predecessor, Assassin's Creed 2, but the few changes are for the better and make this game a hugely enjoyable experience. You continue to play as Ezio Auditore from AC:2, an assassin living in Renaisance Italy. Full of awesome action, believable characters and some crazy new weapons like the crossbow, this game is definetely worth your time and money. I would rate this game a solid 8/10 and would easily reccomend it as one of the best Asssassin Creed games, right behind AC:2.*By the way, don't be fooled by my low hours on this review (6.9 at time of posting), I have played through the entire game before, having only bought it on Steam very recently.",1
2015,"When I hear that 'The Walking Dead' was a point-and-click game by Telltale studios I was really surprised. I couldn't imagine such a complicated concept to be used with such a basic idea. Don't get me wrong though, 'The Walking Dead' is a masterpiece. The choices you make will change the game in HUGE ways.Let's say two people are in life threatening situations and you only have a small amount of time. Who do you save?Do you kill this person? Or let them live?Do you risk your life? Or allow someone else to risk theirs?The zombie apocalaypse is a dangerous place and I cannot even explain how amazing this game can be.Trust me, it is worth your money. This is the only game I have ever rated a 10/10 and it has to be the greatest game I have EVER played, better than any shooter or puzzler.The gameplay mechanics are lacking but if you play this game, you are playing it for the truly compelling, heartbreaking and unbelievable story as you make your way to survival with a young girl who you feel surprisingly protective of, even though you have just met.You'll see.",1
2015,BUY IT.,1
2015,"If you have a couple of friends who like co-op games, then Payday 2 might be the game for you! Bank Robbery Simulator 2014 is full of varied heists, weapons and awesome looking masks. You'll zip-tie hostages, yell guards into submission, cut down waves of incredibly under-trained SWAT soldiers and make a load of cash while you're at it. You can choose to complete heists using stealth, using silenced weapons and signal jammers to finish the mission. Or you can go guns-blazing, equipping flak jackets and assault rifles to bring down hundreds of your foes. Some of the DLC packs are also well worth it, and silently pulling off a particularly difficult heist with your friends is immensely satisfying. This game is well worth the few dollars it costs, and you'll have countless hours of fun while playing. Take note that the single-player is no where NEAR the quality and standard of co-op, and poor teammate AI will seriously bring you down.As long as you have friends to play with, I can almost be certain that you will love this game.Bring on Payday 3!",1
2015,"Arma 3 is a ridiculously complicated military simulator which includes 7 buttons just to look around (that is if you're too special to use the mouse like everyone else). You can play through a bunch of single player scenarios which subject you to taking down the odd bad guy, while knowing that a single stray bullet could end your life. These scenarios are all pretty much the same, move on to the next town, take out the five random guys that are wandering around armed with assault rifles, then repeat. It's multiplayer that makes this game shine, a bunch of modded servers like the immensely popular 'Altis Life' mode in which you can play as a civilian or cop. As a civilian you'll buy your drivers license, set off to a life of adventure, get robbed, stripped naked and kneecapped before being abandonded in the desert. In your next life you'll probably head over to the cocaine field to try and make some easy drug money, right? Wrong. As you fill your pockets with unprocessed cocaine (which look suspiciously like rotten cabbages) you'll likely run into a group of like-minded rebels who will make it their business to brutally kill you and take all of your items which you worked so hard for. Then you respawn with nothing and do it all again. As a cop you'll try to stop this from happening, but you'll probably just taze the wrong guy, run him over, then try to pretend like you never did it. You'll brutally murder a bunch of people completely on accident, that is to say, you pull a guy over for speeding, he annoys you so much that you shoot him with your tazer. Then he has a bad reaction to the tazer and the next thing you know you're cleaning up a dead body.Honestly, do I need to say anymore?",1
2015,"The Walking Dead: Season 2 puts you in control of young girl Clemintine, introduced in Season 1, during the zombie apocalaypse. Along the way you'll meet new companions, fight for your life and make some of the hardest choices you can think of. Your morales will be tested, as you are forced to make decisions that will change the entire experience. Right from the word go you'll be sucked in to the story, feeling for all of the characters and by the end of it you'll wonder where all of your time went. The characters are immensely powerful and when you finally reach the rollercoaster of an ending, you will be left with (in my opinion) some of the toughest decisions in gaming.I would HIGHLY reccomend this game, it surpasses the first game and replaces it in the spot of my favourite game of all time. Definetely play the first game first (it's awesome), THEN play this one. It is spectacular. Telltale has delivered the two best games I have ever played, trust me, you don't want to miss out.",1

2015,"satisfyingly gory without being too morbid about it, a curious look into the inside of the human body with a unique control scheme that is difficult to control but hugely fun to clumsily bump around with.",1
2015,This game is ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. Its not a game its a tool for learning and blowing up little green men.,1
2015,"i lost weeks at a time to playing this game but it gets the heart pumping like nothing else out there. Playing this game is not conducive to leading a productive life IRL, but its defs worth checking out if you have the time to spare.",1
2015,"This game is about the closest thing to ""Virtual Reality"" that is currently available. Now excuse me while i weep in the corner.",1
2015,who knew engineering could be so addictive?,1
2015,"I have no doubt that this game is going to be great once it is complete, until then I expect bugs and glitches, problematic cross platform releases and widespread frustration. It is because of my interest in the intellectual property that I will endure these hiccups because the story that I've only seen 1/6 of so far seems worth it. If you don't have the patience to endure these temporary flaws then I would advise that you wait until after the last episode has been released before getting the game, but if your impatience (like mine) takes the form of needing to know what happens next as soon as ♥♥♥♥ing possible then those things are in all likelihood going to be (and indeed, so far have been) a big part of the experience. OR you could just go and watch a playthrough on the youtubes but then you would miss out on the experience of actually making decisions (not that they really have any impact on the story in the first episode). This game does so far capture the spirit of its source material, and for that it should receive praise, its marketing genius and i'm eating it the ♥♥♥♥ up. woot",1
2015,"This game can be extremely  fun to play if you can just get over the fact that this game hates you. I don't mean that the game is designed to go against you.  I mean the game hates you with a passion. The designers of this game created the first artificial intelligence system designed to mimic the actual emotion of hate.  When you are sleeping, the game is plotting your downfall. Other than that, it is insanelly addictive and mimics the Civilization style ""just-one-more-turn"".",1
2015,"Fantastic and a very underrated game. If you like the Heroes of Might and Magic series, get this game! It is single-player only, but well worth the money and the time.",1
2015,"Might & Magic Heroes VI has the potential to be a superb game, but is held back by one minor and one monumental flaw.The graphics as expected are superior to previous titles in the series. The music and faction/unit versatility is on par at best, though being able to split your upgrades in the previous iteration makes unit upgrades in VI seem like a step backwards. Spells and gear are fairly versatile, though once more there is the issue of an optimal"" gear set and spells which effectively make 3/4 of your arsenal obsolete.One of the  two places where the game falls short for me is the story and character script, which whilst brilliant for most games, just isn't as captivating and moving as previous iterations of Heroes. The second issue, which happens to be the largest deterrent, is the sheer amount of bugs, glitches, freezing and crashes which makes playing the game incredibly frustrating. Seriously Ubisoft... get your ♥♥♥♥ together and fix this!",1

2015,"Mass Effect 2, a thrilling mix of brilliant gameplay and especially excellent storytelling mechanics. This game has kept me interested at every corner. I never lost interest in the brilliant choice making the allowed you. I especially loved the fact that depending on what you chose in certain missions affected your future outcome in later games like Mass Effect 3. This series of games has got to be my utter favorite that I have ever played. I cannot describe the joy I felt, customising my armour, having brilliant dialoge with my crew and doing the excellent missions that were given. This game, and those that preceed and come after it, excite me for the way games are going and where they will end up. In the end the only thing I can say is that I am intently waiting with great anticipation for the next game, Mass Effect 4.",2
2015,"This game is INCREDIBLE. It is so vast and beautiful and will make you gasp with awe as you see the land. It has so many quests as well and it feels endless. I love how when you finally (if ever) run out of quests, the open world allows you to make up your own. The combat is a thrill and i never tire of it. Learning new magic always makes me get so excited and  I love the range of spells alot. This game has so many choices and options and it truely is a game worthy of the title, incredible.",2

2015,"You guys should seriously sit on your asses and work on this game.First of all we payed for it. After Purchasing this game you have to use real money to buy guns and equiptment to surive. If not you have to go through a town of 1000 zombies that kill you instantly while it takes you 1 million hits to kill them.This game is a real cheap version of DayZ and it bugs the f**** out of me of what more they could of done to improve this game. First of all don't make us buy a game where you have to pay real money to ♥♥♥♥ a zombie up the ♥♥♥♥. Make it more realistic and fix the bloody combat because its worse than Elder Scrolls Morrowind. Make it 12 hits to kill a zombie instead of 1 million7 Hits with a Melee weapon1-4 shots depending what type of gun you haveAnd Bingo at least its a little more better than what you have at the moment.The game is set out alright and the atmosphere isn't to bad but still cheap.Its what you would expect from a game made in 2005. The pictures of the game through steam look so epic but trust me it isn't that great. Buy this game right now if you want but I warn you its garbage.If you really want us spending money for this so called game fix it up and update it every bloody week. If not, continue being scammers and using our money to watch your HD p*** EITHER WORK ON THIS MOREOR DELETE IT CAUSE ALMOST EVERYONE HATES IT SO FAR!",1
2015,"Games Best MMORPG Game I'v played in a while. If you hate games with non stop writing then dont play this XDU will hate the Tutorial cause it goes on for like 2 hours but after that you will enjoy it.Its a game based In the 15 Century where you can Sail Boats/Upgrade and buy more and go to war, Sail to almost every Country in the whole World, Upgrade your trade, Adventure and War skills and learn different languages to communicate to people in different countries such as Turkey and Islamic places. Become Accountants and have job Carer. Dont think its that easy to head to city to city One time it took me 2 hours trying to get to Venice to Genoa and thank god people helped me on my way there otherwise i would of never found my way there. You can also go to the bar get drunk have drinks with people and employ saliors to work for you and its damb funI recommend this game and is highly addictive! :)",1

2015,"At first it reminded me of The Impossible Game with 3D backgrounds, you auto-run to the right and jump gaps and rocks, fairly basic right? wrong.In the impossible game you just had to jump gaps and doge spikes, in this you will be jumping obstacles, sliding under UFO's, and kicking your way through crystals, all timed to some awesome sounding Bit-Tunes.Not a fan of Bif-Tunes? Niether am I, but it works so well with the gameplay it sounds a lot better than it normally would, and I am actually motivated to get to the end of each level because I want to hear the rest of the track.The only thing I wish I could improve in this game, is my own skill level.",1

2015,"DISCLAIMER: Ths review is based off very little actual gameplay, but...I have played this game very little, but I am very disappointed.At first Avadon 2 looks like a good throwback to old school RPGs, and it very well might be, however the very first sentence of text in the game was so badly written I barely wanted to continue, but I thought ""Hey, maybe it gets better"", but it didnt...First sentence:""You walk out of your wrecked, garbage-strewn barracks into another, slightly larger, wrecked, garbage-strewn barracks... once you walk outside, ou can find the scout""First part of the game and already running out of words to describe things, not good considering this is meant to be an RPG with a great story.""Its cold outside, but Silke was nice enough to leave your cloak at the door""Okay, well why didnt tey hang it up somewhere instead of leaving iton the floor?""You enter the low hall where the woodsmen who lived and worked here took their meals...""Took their meals? couldnt think of a better word like ""ate""?""You hear scratches, you hope they dont smell you""I hope what doesnt smell me? Do I really stink that bad?""As you leave, Silke puts out the fire""What fire? there is clearly no fire anywhere to be seen, and I was told a minute ago the fireplace inside hasnt been used for months...",1
2015,"After playing for a few hours I can say this game is well worth the $15.4 Character classes, loads of quests and elite monsters to kill, its like if Zenonia and Torchlight II had a baby, then raised it into the best game it could be.The Developer really cares about the game, as does the community, so you can always find someone to play with no matter when you play.I rate the game 9/10, would be a 10/10 but I cant make my character cursor green... :(P.S, If you have any issues check the steam forums, there are a couple of known issues which have easy fixes, should work fine for 99% of people, unless your on win 10.",1
2015,"Even after 4 years I would still highly reccomend picking up this game after the afterbirth were to be released, here's why.Pros:Story is great and has you diggingGameplay is quite enjoyable, given, you don't get bugged af enemiesCharacters are have their own gimmick to them (especially ??? KAPPA)Item's are vast and varried which can also synergise quite well (Some items will be excluded from awesome synergies to basic damage or tears up, really.)It is difficult at first but incredibly fun and easy later on once you learn the game and some movementsEnemies are fair and balanced (Except for maybe 3, which I will discuss later)Graphics are old school which I personally enjoyNow for the bad parts of this gameCons:Spiders and a particular boss (To my knowledge this boss cannot fly over pits but rocks, wtf.) are very buggy and can be at times, unfair.Game lacks synergies which have huge theoretical awesomenessStory can ♥♥♥♥ over your mind quite hardlyBut all in all I give this game 9/10",1

2015,"This game changed my life.No longer can I look at a horse - real or virtual - without thinking ""Gee, I wish I could brush your hair in Secret of the Magic Crystals! It fills me with sadness when I realise that I will never be able to play training games involving tapping the arrow keys in time with the horse's movements with any of these other equines, care for them when they're sick, craft horseshoes from a variety of different metal types, create potions to improve their abilities, or send them to races and quests. And worst of all, they will never know the sheer joy I experience when I find any of the magic crystals scattered across the land.'Secret of the magic crystals' provides you with countless hours of entertainment and uncontrollable joy, however that will be replaced with deepest sadness once you realise you can't live these wonderful adventures in real life.10/10 would buy again, for me and all of my friends",1

2015,"Amazing.Love the different aspects of theis game, the developers realy make you think about how you are going to plan the traps for the night to give you an edge over the monsters.And i love the fact that they make you pay dearly if you have misplaced a trap or a bait and you will have to mak do with your axe.Also making the main character waeker than the enimies is a great idea it realy makes you think that if you have to use hand to hand combat (or in this instance, axe to claw) you have to use every thing you can to get an advantag, from using your musket, making an attmept with your axe, or even luring your enemies to a trap that hasent been used. Also I love that you realy have to use anything to put distance between an army of werewolves and yourself and bonfires are the best to do so, because if you think that if just yur axe will get you through the night your are wrong.And having the buildins to protect is a great idea it makes the night less about making sure that the character lives and more about making sure the builds survive.All in all ""Sang Froid Tales Of Werewolves"" one of the best stratagies/action games I have ever played.Hope they release a sequal, remeber this is tome 1.",2
2015,"Simply put... AMAZING.Greatest game i have played this year. The nemisis system is so facinating how you can make a enemy just by thinking that you have killed someone or they may have killed you, they are not bosses that are in a set place they move around the world and you could just bump into them or they might try and find you to get revenge.. Amazing story that got me right in the feels. Also great level design, theirs something about wandering around mordor that makes you feel at the center of the middle earth universe. Great charchter devolpment. And im looking forward to the dlc to learn more about celebrimbors story.",2

2015,"Very fast action first person shooter. Just pick a gun and you're off. No story or cutscenes etc. Robots just keep coming harder and faster and bigger, while you improve your weaponry and features.Control and gameplay are excellent, though still lacking in movement options like all fps games these days (can't move much while shooting; can't sprint and strafe).Weapon options are quite good. You start with a choice of shotty, assault rifle, battle rifle, and the weaponry builds from there. The middle tier weapon options could include a true auto smg, but it'll get there I'm sure. The shotguns seem OP.Anyway, jump in; grab a gun; shoot until you die!",2

2015,"A Brilliant Game, Stunning Visuals, and a pretty good story line. Only problem? it suffers from repetitivity, not so much as to say dont buy it its $hit, it is actually quite good. The combat is fairly smooth, of course with a few flaws. With the option of allowing you to take on sidequests, help random strangers as you find them or even just continue on with tvehe storyline, hell you can even just run around and smash some skulls in. continuing the reptitivity, it only shows in the missions, of course going backwards ad forwards constantly is annoying, not saying that about half way through the game you want to give up on it because your bored, but its kind of a necessary repetitive, what makes it great is that it continues to surprise you, mainly becasue you will never know what lurks around the corner.... dis gem is gud i lyked it 7/10 would bang",1

2015,"played for 2 hrs at the time of review;certainly a fun little game, wiht the ability to create quite alot of basic things, advanced things and recreate medieval weaponry (also a lot of male items IF YOU CATCH MY MEANING) for example, you could simply make a tower ♥♥♥♥ full of cannons and just shoot them and finish, or you could make an elaborate machine that can plow through enemies wiht ease and still be able to bomb a house, or just make a flying ♥♥♥♥ but you know.Whilst this is still EARLY ACCESS at the time it is quite full of potential, with the addition of like 5 more islands to come soon (there is only one island at this point and it actually gives a fair variety) there is still room for massive bloodbaths and massive castle destructionHonestly for $7, it is worth itA WORD TO THE DEVS; you could put more weapons in, more blocks, and just more building, a tutorial on the flying mechanic (it is a bit confusing, like what do most of this stuff do?) you could put some base vehicles in their, so as a base, you could have a vehicle without weapons and let players mess around with it, or even just make an actual vehicle and let people play with it",1

2015,This game has great potenial the campaign is quite good  online invasion with friends it fun but some of the weapons are simply hard to use some weapons just feel's the same your secondary does no damage whats so ever even to kill a robot on low health  you cannot do. Even though this game was released in 2013 i expected more from sega i rather play jak and daxter on the ps2 i still have more fun buy this game for lols or just with friends. 3/10,2
2015,One of the top zombie games to play,2
2015,Rust was not at all promising at the start as it was still in Alpha most of the server's were filled to the brim with hackers but now Rust is a completely new game as it  focuses it more on survival as most items are crucial to you surviving when i first starting playing the new rust it became more realistic as you needed clothes for warmth and if you were to swim  naked you would come out freezing as would normaly. One of the biggest changes to Rust was the rad zones before on the old Rust rad zones were always the most heated zones as they were always being contested now there are simply no rad zones there are barrels which are spread out throughout the map and there is always the occasional air drop every know and again there also made guns more rare which i love because starting as a fresh spawn in the old Rust and trying to get resources i often found myself dying over and over again to people in full kev but now i just mostly see naked men with bows running around. All i have to say is that the new Rust is what a wanted from the old Rust as it improves all the features from the old and makes its a loveable game again.,2

2014,"I haven't been this invested in an MMO before. It's just perfect in every way, and I really love that you can unlock all jobs/classes on one single character. Love love love Final Fantasy lore and how they've put their own unqiue spin on the genre. There's also a friendly feeling to the game, allowing new players into the genre to be hand-held every step of the way :)",2

2015,This game is overly motion blurred and has only worked for me 3 times and I bought it around last year. I DAMMAND A REFUND!!!,1
2015,This game is just outstandingly addicting for a hardcore online game! if your looking for a game where you slaughter as much as you get bruttally killed then this is the game for you!,1

2015,"A simulation of manslaughter, murder, violence, self defence, agravated assault and grevious bodily harm.I am honoured I had the chance to play such an accurate reflection of what it is like to be in a bar fight.I recomend that the developers consider implementing the following: -Golf course map -Shopping mall map -Jersey shore style hardcore nightclub map -Hockey stadium map -Workshop -No in game purchases please :) -Beach map -Party map -Pool party map -school mapI am aware that the developers have predicted online/Co-op in early january 2016.I highly recommend buying this game if you wish to vent some built up anger, or simpily love gore like me.This game has so much potential, I have a sense of trust for those developing Such a masterpeice. The devs should be proud.7/10",1

2015,"Only played a few hours, partly solo, partly with my brother and a friend. Already got my money's worth. I imagine it will be quite some time before another game captures the spirit of giant-robot-battles-in-space anime as well as this one has.",1
2015,"The fantastic thing about Ultimate Chicken Horse is that you don't even have to be good at it in order for it to be hilarious fun. If you have even one friend to play with in local multiplayer (I can only recommend local multiplayer since that's been my only experience so far with the game) and you can both laugh at your own absurd (and no-doubt plentiful) virtual demises, then this is a game you owe it to yourself to at least try (don't forget - you can refund any game for any reason if you've owned it for under 2 weeks and played under 2 hours!).I already feel that I've had my money's worth from this game, and those I've played with fully agree. My fellow players and I have discussed the game and we agree heartily on its quality.Ultimate Chicken Horse...is accessible to gamers of most skill levels (some basic platforming experience helps).is thoroughly amusing, light-hearted and fun (or, hey, you could play it seriously, hold a tournament! It's very flexible!)plays smoothly.employs simple controls.is quick to learn.features some surprising depth and creativity in combining objects and game mechanics (the 'honey,' especially in combination with moving objects, is my favourite part of the game).has an enjoyable and fitting soundtrack.contains only a few minor issues which only occasionally detract from the experience.has a cute style of animation and cute voices for all the playable animals.features a simple, well-paced progression system, with the important parts (new levels and characters) unlocking early, and the fun little bits (clothes/accessories) unlocking later.uses a clear-cut and simple scoring system that requires little explanation, if any, as most of it can be understood simply by learning through play.can be enjoyable even for less-experienced players - if you're not hung up on the goal of winning and just like having fun, it doesn't matter if you don't often come out on top! Watching others yelp and holler as they navigate a devious stage is half the fun.is thoroughly spectator-friendly.should probably be in your Steam library by now.",1
2015,Blast from the past.. One of the bests,0
2015,"Great game for excercising your brain and micromanaging skills. However the AI leaves a little to be desired with their extremely one-sided trade offers and tendancy to denounce you whenever you lift a finger against another civ, including civs that they are also currently fighting or even to defend your own empire.",1
2015,"Bought this game a couple of years ago now.Steadily played through every update enjoying every new feature implemented and every bug eradicated.Really great developers who have provided a supremely quality product. Ludeon set the benchmark for what a game should be.Congrats on your addition to Steam, this is one of the few indie games on the market here that truly deserve to be here.10/10",1
2015,interesting game wished it was longer it was over so quick the re-playability is limited to how hard it is not much rewards and dante himself has anoying one liners other than that it plays the same as past DMC games suggest a controller cause keybourd is a weird setup,1
2015,"Like all games Ziggurat has its problems, these are at the core, the fact that levels in and of themselves aren't the most well designed things, and that the music isn't really that great.But the problems are overshadowed by what this game does right.This game perfectly brings the concept of a roguelite to the first person shooter genre, having some of the best visuals and gameplays out there, all of this is done in a dark comedic and cartoonish way that will have you constantly switching weapons, sprinting, jumping and varying between fire modes constantly. Atop this it manages to massively improve on roguelite concepts by giving you choices in character leveling by letting you choose between a pair of random perks with each level. While the game contains perma death, each time you die or progress further you will unlock new equipment.Overall this is hands down the greatest game to reach an official release this year, being almost glitch free and containing mountains of content, it is an absolute MUST PLAY for ANY rogue-lite, RPG or FPS fan. The devs are so confident you will love it, they simply show gameplay for the trailers, if that isn't product confidence, I don't know what is.",1
2015,"This has got to be one of the best racers I've ever played <3 I only ever originally played the first game and I loved it and only recently decided to give the other games a try. 2 I gotta say has to be not just one of the best racing games I've ever played but one of the best games I've ever played in general, same with the series FlatOut istelf, although 3 is a pile of ♥♥♥♥ by looking at the negativity, so might not play it unless I want a full and fair opinion of it. FlatOut 2 is game where the races never feels too easy like a lot of other racers, and never seems to get boring with it's amount of destruction and intensity it has.",2

2015,"I'll give you a good idea of what will happen during the first hour of the game. Firstly you will wake up on a sandy beach scratching that tiny misquito bite on your arm. You look around and realise you are surrounded by a bunch of dinosaurs, but don't panic not all of them are out to eat you, except for those Dilos those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s would eat their own babies if given the chance. First thing you need to do is punch a tree, yes I said punch a tree. Then collect some berries to eat. Oh no looks like you are thirsty, go take a dive into the water to have a drink. Run away there a giant shark thing chasing you. Oh you just pooped, it's edible but I wouldn't recommend it. Oh look a dilo just killed you.Until you get the hang of this game you will die, a lot. But it is definitely one of the most fun games I have played in a very long time. It's still in Early Access so a lot of the content hasn't been implemented and there are still a lot of bugs. Even so there is heaps to do and the developers are amazing as they release a new patch everyday.",1
2015,"Probably one of the funniest things I have ever played in recent memory. Some things like to bug out, but it's these bugs which sorta add to the appeal of the whole game.Having said that though, the novelty does wear off fairly quickly, and you may only get a couple of hours out of the game before you start to get bored. I'd recommend waiting until the Workshop starts filling up with more stuff once the game is actually out on Steam before buying, so you can guarantee yourself hours of fun!",1
2015,"Alright so this is coming from a guy who doesn't necessarily not like, but isn't a fan of traditional RPGs.If you're doubting buying this game, look how much time I've sunk into it. It's not overly long like other RPGs (I got the normal and 'true' endings in a little over 12 hours gameplay, and to be quite honest I don't have the heart to do the genocide ending), but it'll take a lot longer if you explore every nook and cranny the world.Now you're probably thinking ""Gee willikers, only 12 hours? Is this pile of poop really worth tenbux?""My answer is simply: HELL ♥♥♥♥IN YES.Admittedly, it might take a certain type of person to really enjoy this game, and if you're not a fan of RPGs this game probably isn't for you, but if you're that type of person... wow, Undertale is definitely a candidate for GOTY. This game will toy with your emotions, throw curveballs at you when you least expect it, probably frustrate you with a couple of fights, and you will love every single moment of it. And also probably cry. And definitely laugh.And even then, if you're still doubting buying this video game after reading this and the hundreds and hundreds of other positive reviews like these, grab it anyway and if you don't like it, get a refund from Steam before you hit the 2 hour mark. That and there's also a short demo on the official website. A very easy way to make sure that <$1/hr of good light-hearted and feel-good (unless you don't want it to be) entertainment is right for you!",1

Hell yeah i can build a castle with those 100000000+ bricks and blocks from the loots! And welcome to the railcraft. How awesome it is in the world of railgun.

2015,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth pits you aggainst a procedurally generated 30-50 minute challenge of floors riddled with gruesome and challenging enemies room for room, where you have an arsenal of cleverly articulated items and upgrades to aid you on your journey. Every play through can unlock a vast plethora of new items, bosses, rooms and challenges, that furthermore aggrandize the expansiveness of the endless experience. Each playthrough is unique- you could be gushing damaging beams of blood for one playthrough, then struggle with strenuously low damage the next. There is a real challenge to be had with this game, but with perseverance you find yourself rejoycing with reward. A difficult and rewarding rogue-like twin stick shooter, with thoughtful game design that may falter rarely due to occassionally stressful item drops, charming animations and dark tone, that overall provides a fun and refreshing challenge that contrasts the easy and hand holdy natrure of most modern games- 9.7/10",1

Spec Ops investigates what the darker side of war is, such as the underlying intergrity of orders and duty in a mission, decsions made by soldiers towards the execution of a ""success"", and the psychological toll of killing and navigating a war zone. As for the gameplay, the third person mechanics work very well and the combat is very dynamic thanks to an interactive envrionment and exceptional friendly and hostlile AI. What's unique to Spec Ops is it's rich narrative (including the dark themes explored) and the fact that it's a shooter that isn't designed to mow down waves of enemies, drive cars through helicopters and surviving skyscraper collapes...

2012,"Bioshock Infinite is the most perfect game I have ever played. You are instantly immersed through the rich and soft textures and the angelic lighting that is the beauty of the oil painting styled, floating city of Columbia. Your immersion only deepens upon hearing the game's soundtrack, the wonderful voice acting and the lively and interactive enrionment that surrounds you. The immersion sits the player down, orientates and plunges them into an incredibly rich story that discusse an alternate realm of 20th century America, in which post-moderinism has sky-rocketed however the scientific marvels are under the control of ""the Prophet"", who preaches a religion very similar to Christianity. Through his dominion over Columbia he his created corruption in the city and a severe class division, also, he keeps his daughter locked away in a tower that overlooks the city. As Booker Dewitt, you are tasked to rescue the girl from the tower and return her to New York to pay your debts. However, the story goes above and beyond your original plans and transform into a materfully crafted journey into self-discovery and the liberation of a religously/poltically opressed city. What makes this story so rich and immersive is it's use of  quantam physics' String Theory, as a key plot structure. String Theory explores the fundamental forces in the world, the consquences of hidden dimensions, number of dimensions and the supersymmetry between dimensions. Needless to say the context, the plot, the graphics, the themes, and the gameplay will leave you breathless.The Burial At Sea DLC is also incredible. ",1

2015,Civilization 4 is the last to really the last edition that remains true to the traditional Civ formula. It adds the additional element of religions which creates an interesting gameplay as you try to convert other civilisations to the religion you found - so that you can make more money.

2014,"Been playing since the 1.4 patch of DayZ, so you'll know this is coming from a DayZ fan at heart. When Rocket promised and informed us about standalone we all cheered! What's more he said it'll be done by 2012 Christmast! We were kind of sad when Chrismast time passed and the standalone was no where to be seen.Several months later both good and bad things surfaced. WarZ being released and ofc the final development cycle of Standalone. Everyone thought it would come out 2014 and out of no where. The game appeared on Steam's Early Acess.I instantly bought it and theres something I have to say. It's really ALPHA. So early into alpha that the game is poorly opitimized, no anti-hacks have been implemented and glitches galore. That being said there are some redeeming factors.It's absolute fun. Fun to the point where. I don't care anymore if I died from a glitch. Ironically because this game's loot is so unbalanced that you can gear yourself up in 10 minutes. Looting is soo much fun. Being a veteran in DayZ usually mean surviving for weeks and always go for high-value loot buildings. Even though it's the same mapandsame premise I'm actually looting houses for food.It was worth my money. Thats all that matters",1

I get excited about finding new places. Surviving is challenging but not so much that you just want to give up (that said, you have to be smart; i wasn't watching where I was going and fell off a cliff, and there's no respawn here.)

2015,"This is the best survival game I have ever played; not that that's saying much, as I haven't played many, with most of them being zombie-based. I don't think I've ever seen a game quite like this, in that it's just you in a wilderness with only your wits and some luck to keep you alive. Especially considering it's an alpha game with 6 zones and only sandbox, this game looks beautiful, sounds beautiful and can be both hauntingly beautiful and completely terrifying. The difficulty settings are pretty fair; the easiest difficulty makes it easier to appreciate the cold beauty and deadly serenity  of the game, the middle is harsh but fair (sometimes), and I haven't even looked at the most difficult.All in all, best $20 I have ever spent.",1

2015,"It's really good. A little difficult to get into at first but worth it. Amazing tech tree, like a spider web. I loved that when you are fighting an AI player their units are different to yours because they have chosen a different path in the tech tree. AMD graphics card is still producing slightly shaky graphics; live in hope that they're going to fix this one day. Ironic because the game starts with an AMD splash. Also, no score or monument produced at the end of the game - I mised that. Overall, though, worth the money and an excellent game. It isn't Alpha Centauri II and it it isn't Civ-lite. It's a whole new experience.",1
2015,"Totally addictive - after 40 hours of playing, I'm still returning to try and get those goods to Dubai on time. The game starts well, introducing you to small loads and quick trips. You don't realise it expanding around you as Northern Europe sends goods to the Mediterranean and North Africa. And then you're sending goods to America on bigger and bigger ships. Just when you think you're safe, the Investor comes and takes her cut and suddenly you're scrabbling for money. Do you risk taken the dubious goods for the Don? Of course you do, you're desparate for income and here comes the Customs to catch and fine you...It's more challenging than it seems and building your shipping line is more satisfying than you'd think. It's the exact example of powerful gameplay over expensive graphics.",1

2015,An all time sci-fi classic and a brilliant game and an epic sequel to one of the best shooters of all time - making it also one of the best shooters of all time. I could elaborate more but instead I think I'll just say you REALLY have to play it if you haven't already and if you have played it you know it's the best!,1
2015,True classic. Fight against the zombie horde in an effort to survive with your friends!! My only criticism is that this (as well as the Legend of Zelda and Mario) is a complete ripoff of Halo. Good game.,1
2015,"This game is epic!! (Literally as it is really large). Appart from that the gameplay, missions and graphics are excellent, you could plug the HDMI cable into your head and just live in there away from the real world - and not be bored for the next millenia. However the ability to move and shoot stuff in this game is evidence that it is a complete rip-off Halo as in Halo you can move and shoot stuff as well (clear proof) XD.",1
2015,"They say variety is the spice of life and this is what makes Borderlands 2 such a red-hot game; elements such as the endless weapon variation, quirky sense of humour, cartoon decor and almost-comical violence really leave a great and addicting impression of the game to players. Gearbox have truly made a masterpiece shooter. Enjoy!! (or buy if you haven't already)",1
2015,"I give it 7.5/10BioShock Infinite, like the rest of the of the BioShock franchise, was very enjoyable to play, combat was highly enjoyable and graphics were great. However I'd still say that the original BioShock was alot more entertaining.I was slightly disappointed that BioShock Infinite didn't live up to expectation set by developers in early production. Even elements shown in the Beta game-play seemed to be non-existent: such as being fired at with artillery weapons and having a telekinesis power to stop the shells, sandbox level design, larger and more open areas and the random collapse of buildings as well as random weather events. However due to time, story and technology restraints many of these features were unrealistic so many of this is excusable - yet still leaves me mildly disspointed.Also I found the ending to be a bit weak, but enjoyable none-the-less. The re-playability is also somewhat non-existent do to the linear level design that isn't present in the previous BioShock games that would have left you searching through every corner of the map in the hope that you may have missed something. I still strongly recommend playing the game. Good job 2K.",1

2015,"The most enjoyable First Person Shooter you will ever play. The gameplay and multiplayer all just feels so fluent and smooth, it's competetive and simple, but still complex and challenging enough to keep you coming back for more. The DLC's are also reasonable value for money, unlike what you'd expect from Battlefield 3 or 4. The art style is fun, it's relaxed and not overdone with millions of attachments and weapons to overwhelm you. Vehicle gameplay in BC2 is done right, with a large variety of vehicles to choose from which will be useful in almost every situation imaginable.  This was the last Battlefield game which had truly great level design, and a decent dog tag / knifing action. Grabbing someone's tags in this game means so much more than any other Battlefield, the knife gameplay is absolutely addictive and actually takes a reasonable amount of skill and timing, unlike what you'll find in the luck-of-the-draw systems which seem to be in the newer Battlefield titles. All in all, great game. 10/10",1

2015,"Finally, the multiplayer was given a shake-up to refresh an old and long-repeated system, which really made this game stand out from the other 10 games in the series. It's a real shame there's hardly a community on PC, because I would've sunk many more hours into this, had there been an active and thriving community.",1
2015,"Uncharted for PC. This was the first time I had ever played a Tomb Raider game, and I very much enjoyed my experience. The game feels very reminiscent of the Uncharted series on Playstation, and I mean that in the best sense possible. Whether it be the lovely and complex level design, the third-person parkour and enjoyable combat systems, or the focus on a well-built plot paired with decent character development + decent cut scenes makes the game awesome in literally every aspect. Play it, enjoy it and never look back.",1
2015,"Grid 2 is certainly one of the best racing games I've played in a long time. The controls feel very fluid and the graphics are great, there's hardly any complaints I could make.

2015,"It's certainly a great parody of the plethora of other simulation games that are everywhere on steam, and Goat Simulator delivers as a fun, quick game to muck around in. It's only a very short game, and will only really provide a few hours of fun at most, but the price tag is representative of this fact. Great game to let a friend play and screw around in, this game delivers in being different, funny and absolutely ridiculous at times.",1

2015,"Dont know why people dislike this so much :P I enjoy it to be honest. It'd be so much better though with dedicated servers, and if not so many players camp on tdm especially :P Perhaps everyone hated it because there were so many hackers after its release.

2015,"This is a great game with variety mixing swordplay and sourcery, players will experience great dominance over the opposing team or other players in free for all, it's a success and I personally love it. Recommended for everyone.",1
2015,"This is my first review of a game, I usually never do this but this game deserves it, it's a nice sandbox game similar to minecraft, and the reviews other people have posted are true, this is truly a great game where you can express most of your imagination into with Lego, when I was a kid I always used to play with it and make weird cars, or buildings or anything else really, and now I can virtually do that! but overall this game is amazing, the camera can be a little dodgy however and when it comes to building sometimes too, but they're really the only minor cons in this game, nothing to say ""this game is crap now because of these cons!"" but besides those it's worth buying and trying out yourself if you haven't bought it or played it yet.I do hope as well that the developers will include most of their Lego franchises into the game, such as Star Wars and Jurassic Park, Batman and Marvel, etc., like being able to drive your own X-Wing or Batmobile, even make a Batcave and all sorts, and hopefully later on will be able to build and drive our own vehicles too. Either way I recommend this!Thanks for reading :D",1

2015,"Antichamber is one of those games where you can sit down, aiming to complete it within the set 01:30:00, and get up after that time having only run around aimlessly with no knowledge of where to go or what to do next. You will leave the game dazed and confused. It's brutal; it plays with your head, and it does things no puzzle game ought to do.I can't recommend it on the basis of consistent playability; I've played a mere three hours, and they're on-and-off as I occasionally fire up the game in order to lose myself a bit more. I've also never completed the game, or felt I've ever been close to doing so. What I can recommed it for, is the way it makes you rethink the situation at hand; the way it forces you to think outside the box; the way it pushes you into the unknown and is then quite happy to string you up like a puppet and watch you repeat the same futile exercises over and over, hoping something will change, hoping that you will find another room in which it can mess with your head a little more.Can you escape the Antichamber?",1

2015,"TL;DR: There is currently an issue with FFXHD not flagging itself for use on a dedicated GPU in a system with switchable graphics. In addition to this, during my testing (unknowing running on the iGPU), the game has a tendency to crash when transitioning between areas. It's hard to say why, but regardless until these issues are resolved I'd suggest holding off. Users running into issues where FFXHD does not use their dedicated graphics are advised to manually run the executable and forcing the game to use the dedicated graphics in their system.## OVERVIEW AND MAJOR COMPLAINTSAt this point in time, Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD is a known quantity. You can read any review of the previous incarnations of FFXHD to know what the gameplay is like. FFX is a legendary PS2 title, pushing the barrier for graphical fidelity at the time.My biggest gripe so far is the tendency to crash. I've encountered issues where the renderer stops updating the display, causing the game to appear frozen but still be 'playable'. I believe this was an issue with my Intel graphics driver crashing, but haven't done enough testing to see if the issue is still present after a driver update. This could be linked to an issue I talk about in the performance section of this review.The far more common issue is a straight crash-to-desktop when transitioning between areas. It has happened twice during the first underwater segment, and again on Besaid after Wakka asks Tidus to join the blitzball tournament. This is a frustrating problem.## GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCEThis PC release offers a variety of graphical options and improvements over the various console releases. While gameplay is locked to 30fps, menus appear to render at the refresh rate of your display (which for me is 60Hz). This might be a cause of concern for some, but personally while I'd prefer there be no framerate cap, a game like FFX is perfectly playable at 30fps.In terms of performance, I've been playing FFXHD on my laptop, hardware wise it's a ZenBook UX303LN with a dual-core Core i5-4210U @ 1.7 GHz, a 2GB GeForce 840M and 12GB of RAM. Currently, there appears to be an issue where FFXHD is flagged to run on the iGPU instead of the dGPU, meaning instead of using the GeForce 840M, FFXHD has been running on Intel HD Graphics 4400. This is my primary reason for not recommending this just yet, in addition to the crashes.Performance on the HD 4400 has been above expectations. The game runs at 1080p on the Low preset with textures on High at 30fps in most environments. Typical for integrated graphics, the framerate dips into the mid-20s in scenes with lots of lighting effects. Combat for the most part runs at 30fps (again depending on the environment), but attacks with lots of effects or explosions cause the framerate to tank fairly sharply. The GPU is given full license to clock up to 1,000 MHz with memory at 800 MHz and a temperature of around 73C-75C. I'm fairly impressed with these results given how limited the shader performance and memory bandwidth is on the HD 4400.As for performance on the GeForce 840M, the game runs at 1080p on the Medium preset with textures on High and anti-aliasing turned off. Exploring around the early areas of Besaid the game sticks to 30fps with GPU usage around 95%-98%. In a battle scene on Besaid, GPU usage drops to around 85%. The 840M is allowed to turbo to its full 1,124 MHz core speed and 900 MHz memory speed and temperatures sit at around 73C in my ZenBook UX303LN. Once again, I'm pleased with these results, given the 840M isn't exactly a gaming powerhouse.However, In reality I shouldn't even have to have two sections for performance. The game should be running on dedicated graphics in systems that have it. Whether this is an issue for Square Enix to resolve, or if Nvidia can resolve this with a driver update, it's still dissapppointing to see. Performance numbers across the board are better than I expected, so I see no isses with optimisation here, just the issue with GPU switching and crashes.## CONCLUSIONSThe issues outlined here form the basis of my decision to not recommend this game at this time. Crashing to the desktop is a frustrating experience, and users should not have to manually set a game to run on their dedicated graphics.However, when these issues are resolved, I will ammend this review and give FFXHD a solid recommendation. If you believe you're happy to work around these issues as they currently stand, by all means the game has my recommendation. But until they're resolved, this review ends without a recommendation from me.",1
2015,"Grand Theft Auto IV is one of the best games ever, no questioned asked. Highly realistic, extremely well done realistic graphics. One of the best New York landscape games out there. You basically can do whatever you want in this. Well almost.",1
2015,"Left 4 Dead 2 is one the greatest zombie games out there. Well done format. Very good maps. Highly texturely maps. Many easter eggs aswell.

2015,"2K games really swung for the fences with Mafia II. Unfortunately, at the last second, a ridiculously fast outfielder scaled the wall and caught the ball to deny the homerun. Then the fielder turned around and threw it back. After that the metaphor kind of falls apart.Mafia II is a great game, with high technical marks and a compelling story tailored for an adult audience, but its lack of depth and substance will ultimately drop it from being a classic to just being a good game. Which is a shame, because it really is a fun game, and with a little more time, 2K Czech’s Mafia II could have been something special.The story really pulls the player in. With it's twisted story and scenes. This game is very good and will go down in video game history. I give Mafia II 9.0/10 ",1
2015,"The binding of isaac, Well what is there to say about this, this game is all the way about religion with a cartoon twist. Isaac who is about to be killed by his mom, jumps down to the basement where he will have to fight his way to survive and at the end, he will fight his mom. Binding of isaac is a very rage inducing game. You might of gotten to the last level and die and go to the very begginning. But thats what makes it addiciting. I think binding of isaac is a great game, especially with the DLC (WRATH OF LAMB) I give Binding Of Isaac a 8.5/10",1
2015,There always something more to the game then meets the eye. You are in the game. Choice making changes the course of the game. This game is one of the best of 2012. It is never ending action and suspense. Horror. This game is one of a kind. 10/10,1
2015,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, This is game is just counter strike with new skins and highly redesigned textures for the most part, As for many players, the game seems more easier and for some more harder. The game is 14.99 and is a good buy if your wanting to start counter strike, and i know, i know people are going to say get counter strike 1.6 or counter source. But depending on your budget and if your into good graphics, i guess get this then. This game is alright buy, jsut skins thats all your getting from it. I'm giving Counter-Strike: GO a 7.5/10",1

2015,"Fun game, though it gets somewhat limited in replayability. It's best played with friends/clan, where you can form larger team and work together.",1
2015,"Absolutely FANTASTIC zombie survival, especially for a free download. The only problem I've found is that you need a strong ping in order for it to be playable, a somewhat ordinary ping seems to make the zombies are bit weird. Would reccommend, tonnes of fun with friends, low system requirements and it's free so everyone can play! (Good for LAN parties)",1
2015,10/10 absolute bliss to play,1
2015,"Decent game, becomes a little bit monotonous, however, I suspect it becomes more exciting further into the game than I have played. Good co-op action, though I would've liked perhaps teamwork to be more of a requirement rather than a ""everyone charge at the enemies and spam attack buttons"". However, it has nice visuals, smooth gameplay and enjoyable multiplayer. Good if you need a quick multiplayer game to play with friends.",1
2015,"Although some of the controls for the mini game can get quite fiddly and annoying, the scale and amount of content packed into this game is breaktaking. I've completed the story and a large amount of the othr content, 27 hours or so through and only up to 30% complteion. You know how people complain about games being released with too little content and too much DLC? Well, this game is how it should be- tonnes of content and tonnes of fun!",1

2015,"Ok I'll give it to you straight, This is a very short game around, one weekend you can finish the campaign! But this really is not a factor in this RTS, This game represents how good RTS games can be by providing you some of the best multiplayer ever seen with you having MOBA fights or massive land battles with you and a friend. The Graphics are far more superior than DOW one and has much better strategy but BEWARE, If you want a 1000 v 1000 battle your dreaming. I am speaking harshly about this game, but only because its so good to play and deserves to be in every one's steam View list as a Favourite or Favorite, if your American. One of the best RTS games is here! Although this is a bit dear, you get what you pay for. $40. May the Ork blood be forever on your chainsaw!",2

This is a must have, to anyone and everyone you must get this game, it's a allrounder with stylish graphics vast landscapes and custom heroes!!! :) 9/10",2
2015,"Great game, love a lot of the ideas implemented! I'm a sucker for rep grinding!",1
2015,"First off, let me just mention that I loved Terraria back when it was released. A two-dimensional minecraft with tons more unique creatures and biomes, not to mention unique bosses for different sections of the world.Now we see this beautiful casual gaming masterpiece we know as Starbound; much like Terraria, but on a much, MUCH larger scale. It may not have as many pre-designed creatures, and the procedurally generated ones may not be much to talk about either, but when combined with the variation of the different worlds' landscapes and scenery, procedurally generated or not, they fit in very nicely with the worlds around you. There are many more block types, most of which share a theme with other blocks. If put together correctly, you could even create a style completely different from that of the rest of the game. The bosses are okay. In a way, they feel like your average boss in Terraria; quite tough when you get to it, possibly even inspiring during your first time fighting it, but once you beat them once, it's like riding a bicycle.And although the gameplay is solid, addictive, and most importantly FUN, I will admit that what really caught my attention when I started playing this game was the character customization, whether it be via the character creator, cosmetic items found in-game, or a combination of the two. And this leads in to another topic of discussion: roleplay. I'm quite into it, and believe me when I say that this game is bursting with potential in terms of roleplay. The game has a linear storyline with non-linear gameplay, allowing the player to complete the game at their own pace, or simply choose not to complete the game at all. With this in mind, the player may choose to complete the game in order to get it out of the way or simply not do anything and stop tracking Esther's quests if that furthers their concentration on whatever activities they may be pursuing, such as roleplay, building a colony, exploring, or any combination of those.Now if you'll excuse me, I have an appointment to kick Big Ape's @$$ in about half an hour, so enjoy the game and its future updates. This game is definitely recommended by me and earns my seal of approval (which doesn't really mean much and is only meant to emphasise my fondness for this game)",1

2015,"Bastion is an amazing game which came as a surprise to me. I saw this game was on sale and decided to pick it up little did i know that i was in for an unforgetable gaming experience.  Bastion has some very fun and simple gameplay, you get a wide variety of weaponary at your disposale and while the game can get difficult at time it rarely managed to take away from the experience and made me want to improve my skill. The story in this game was also quite well done, something you have probably heard about this game is how wonderful the narraration is and i can't agree more, the narrarator comments on almost everything you do and moves the plot along, The narraration brought the game alive and made things as dull as walking from point A to point B much more enjoyable and quirky. In conclusion i really enjoyed this game and reccomend it to all gamers new or old it easily can retain your attention for the 6 or so hours the original campaign takes, not to mention the challenges and multiple ending which can add even more hours to an already amazing game. At $15 you cant go wrong and if you find it cheaper i would reccomend a swift purchase, this game should not be missed out on.",1
2015,"The Darkness released early February 2012 and was a game that didn’t receive much advertising or player generated hype. The Darkness 2 follows the story Jackie Estacado a mob boss who inherits a peculiar ability which is wielding the Darkness. The game uses cell shading similar to borderlands which compliments the game world well. The gameplay is quite original and lets you “quad-wield” which basically means you can wield a gun in each hand while also controlling your two darkness demon arms. The controls feel a bit fiddly when using a mouse and keyboard, if you own a controller I would recommend using that instead. This game has some of the most gruesome kills I have ever seen in a game. Using your demonic arms you can rip your enemies in half, slice of their head or even pull out an enemy’s spine from his butt the list goes on. The single player campaign took me about 6 hours on my first play through and left me wanting more, not because the game was bad but because it was so darn good. There is also a co-op campaign which was fun to play with friends but got boring very quickly. In summary, I really enjoyed this game and its unique gameplay but found it was bit to short.",1
2015,"This game in one word is AMAZING. I haven't felt this attached to a game charcter in so long, while the gameplay can feel lackluster at times and the puzzles being plain and simple, the real reason you want to play this game is for the story. This game is all about choices and how you react in various social situations during a zombie apocalypse. This game is a must play and if you havent tried it yet you are really missing out on one of the best storylines in gaming, ever.",1
2015,"The original Borderlands was amazing but its main selling point was how fun it was with friends and Borderlands 2 is no different. If you played the original you will feel at home with Borderlands 2, except everything has been improved. More varied quests and locations, new classes and NPCs, improved graphics and best of all new GUNS!!! If you didn’t enjoy the original Borderlands then I can’t really recommend this game for you because the game hasn’t changed enough to draw in those who didn’t like the first, however those who missed the bandwagon in 2009 should jump on now with a three friends and appreciate this magnificent game. The only gripe I had with the game was that when playing single player the game can slow down and you can get bored quite fast. So in simple terms, if you have a enjoy cooperative shooters this game is for you, lone wolves won’t enjoy this quite as much but it is still a ride worth taking if only just to experience the beauty of Pandora.",1
2015,"Call of Juarez, i have hated this series up until this game, don't get me wrong the Call of Juarez games have always had potential but it was always missing something. Gunslinger doesn't tote the same budget, publicity and length as the games that came before, but damn is it fun as hell. The story follows a veteran bounty hunter Silas Greaves who shares his adventures to patrons at a bar. Most of the action takes place via flashbacks and while the game is quite linear the fast pace of the game more then makes up for it. The game took me 5 hours to finish and while it was short, i think the length worked well for the game and if the game dragged on for much longer it would have gotten very dry and boring. This game is really fun and worth playing even if you didn't like previous Call of Juarez games.",1

2015,"This game has some interesting things about it... but.... idk.... its a bit lame and soggy :/ dont think of it as a city builder from a gods perspective, but more like, something a fat alcoholic, diabetic, heart attackishperson designed who never played a game before.... just, dont play it.... its realy dry.... but has some cool sounds in game...... PS.... the game distription is SOOOO deciving, just, if it was not worth any money, this would b ok, and acceptable for gamers.............",1
2015,"Nice variations in the campaign, as compare to Shogun2 and other total war games.... still the general idea of distroy EVERYTHING!",1
2015,"wow reliving my childhood in hd!... well higher res at least... as far as i am concerned, this game trumps AOE1,2 and 3... easily (same conceptwith skirmish and kill you enemies but more ecenomic ability, better fighting not just rediculous sized armies with pandas that shoot lasers! OH CANADA)",1
2015,"This game is tha BOMM! i am a massive fan to the LOTR stories, this merges in quite nicely too.",1
2015,"Ok this is a great game! very similar to the orrigional. However, only buy it on sale, unfortunatly i do not think this game is worth $50. particualy after the mess of the past 3 stronghold games.",1
2015,"seriously cool game, but destroyed by poor optimisation.",1
2015,"overall, its a pretty bad game. the Campaign for a start, i dont even know if im alive atm! (pls wtf) and it just feels like there are WAY TO MANY ENEMIES (the ai sucks too) so this makes it a massive cluster f*ck of swirling sh*t. i hate it a lot. Zombies is just the same crap as it used to be, except there are even more glitches to make it an impossible experience. Multiplayer on the other hand is quite fun. bust MP i have played on any COD i think. it just needs more guns with better mechanics for each. i cannot feel the power of firing the weapons like in Bops1 ( all weapons felt different), instead all the fu*king guns feel the same. and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ glitchyness problems are a pain in the ♥♥♥. has to freeze at least once every two games, and at the most inconvenient times too. fml this will be the last COD i ever play. sick of ♥♥♥♥ devs working under unrealistic timeframes and creating the worst ports to PC in gaming history. ONLY PLAY IF YOU ARE INTO MP (MUST BE ON SALE!!!!!) not worth any more than $50. i say this because its an incomplete product with all kinds of flaws both story and gameplay wise.",1
2015,"This is my 2nd Favorite MOBA behind DOTA and in front of Lol. This MOBA, i feel it's conciderably easier than DOTA and Lol,  with really interesting ideas including auto buy items and auto Lvl skills, this SERIOUSLY takes away any confusion people may have with MOBAs in the crucial areas of Builds and tactics. The 3rd person aspect to this MOBA makes it very unique and it does not deduct from gameplay at all! and for that reason i rate SMITE at 9/10My only gripe with this game is the somewhat clunky feel to the camera. i think if it was made smother, this would be ♥♥♥♥tasticPLAY THIS GAME! ITS REALLY FUN!!!!",1
2015,"I have only just jumped on, and its a 10mins+ waiting for a game before my impatience gets the better of me and /ragequitWhere are the players?",1

2015,so estou recomendando,1
2015,"pretty cool for an early acess, but could have multiplayer.Note: 9,75/10",1
2015,"An absolute masterpiece from the Gameplay, to the Music and design. AN ABSOLUTE MUST FOR ROGUE-LIKE/ACTION GAMERS!!",2
2015,"Undertale caught me completely off guard. As someone who enjoys a traditional RPG, and a story rich game with so much hidden lore, and a great soundtrack, I thought i'd give it a go. To be honest, I wasnt expecting much.This game, however, is EASILY one of the greatest games I have ever played, and it's truly deserving to be ranked high in the all time greats.The charm, the humour, the puzzles, the story, the finale (oh dear LORD the finale...I cant stop thinking about it), the philosophical nature of the game, the various pathways to take, the music, the fleshed out characters you genuinely care about...It's all somehow very beautifully tied together in this 4-6 hour game.You'll be replaying this game just like I did, and I imagine you'll see gaming, and the medium in general, in completely different ways.10/10 without a doubt in my mind.",2
2015,Omg this game is fun haha. I like the mechanic where instead of saving yourself you have to fill yourself to win :) I reccomend this game to you guys and your friends,1

2015,What is the first step to an awesome game?GIVE EVERYONE FREAKIN JET PACKS FROM THE GET GO!Seriously this is an awesome and addicting game. Recommened for everyone.I don't even have the right hardwear to play this with out it lagging out and crashing and poor graphics and it is still amazing!,2
2015,"I never was a big fan of the Half-Life series, I especially though this game was decent at least, but other people seem to call this ""the best FPS ever"" and ""one of the best games ever"". Personally, I just thought the game was mediocre.The gameplay is nothing really that special, it's a first person shooter, and a very simple one at that. I do like the range of weapons, from pistols to rifles to shotguns, and you can carry them all at one, so there is a lot of variety, much like Bioshock. However, the puzzles are extermely straight forward and the vehicles are so finicky, I press the D key for a millisecond and the entire boat goes in a 90 degree angle, the gameplay was just simple and nothing special. It just got boring for me in the end.The graphics weren't bad, for 2004 they look quite good, but to today's standards, they are a bit outdated to today's standard's like Infamous Second Son and the new Wolfenstein. Also I didn't care for the story or the character's for that matter, especially Gordon Freeman. He is possibly one of the boring video game protagonist. He is basically just there as a object of plot, he could be more intersting if we actually heard him speak, but he is just boring. People say that he is like Link from the Legend of Zelda, but the thing with Link is you can see his facial expreesions and see how he is feeling, making him more developed, Freeman is blank with no word of dialouge and no face in game. He is not a charactter, he is an object.Personally, I don't like this game, because of the high critical acclaim it got, and it had a very sour payoff. If you like this game, that's fine, go ahead and play it, but for me, I'll pass when Half-Life 3 eventually comes out.",1

2015,as soon as you get into the game you have so much fun just with the movement system :D.,2
2015,I've never hated a game and ♥♥♥♥ing loved it at the same time. Best game 10/10 chickens.,2
2015,One of the best games I have played. The DLCs are ♥♥♥♥ing awesome too.,2
2015,"This is a great military simulator, much like ArmA2 but completely improved graphics, dialogue etc. The campaign is pretty long and there is also enough scenarios to keep you busy for a good 30+ hours solo, but after that there the multiplayer which is 100% more fun with friends. Overall, great military simulator.. but it is a SIMULATOR, this isn't Call of Duty fellas, yes there is bang bang in every mission, but it it a simulator (cannot stress enough)! If you want to get the most fun out of this game then you need to role play and not go all CoD style and run and gun everything with 2 legs (save that for multiplayer). Appart from that, I had many hours of enjoyment and many more to come!",2
2015,"A game that will convince you that others are complete ♥♥♥♥wits, don't trust anyone, any advantage to gain and survive take it.challenging and addicitve, a game that will make you laugh, cry and go off your balls, it's a must have or at least you should give it a go.",1

2015,"I punched a guy several thousand times and was labled a psychopath before climactically leaping to the roof. Thus it is a fun game for the three hour maximum it takes to finish and quite good value for a few hundred megabites worth of funny, quirky videogame",1
2015,"Long story short, this is the best game I've ever played. The universe and atmosphere are so interesting and lively, the story goes from cutesy highschool drama to really dark themes very quickly and finally, and most importantly, this game made me feel something. I genuinely cared for the wellbeing of the two main characters which is more than I can say for any game I've played previously and this only adds the the emotional devastation that comes from some scenes. The only one thing about the game I could say I dislike is the endings clearly limited by time constraint and budget but otherwise, the experience was one that I'll not soon forget. If you're thinking of buying this game, stop thinking. You're only wasting the time you could be spending playing it.9.9/10",1

2014,"Amazing game, vvery funny and enjoyable. Highly recomended.",2
2015,"This game is wrongly accused of being pay-to-win. This is a pay-to-progress title, and the devs are workgin on making it less and less so. By reducing the bonuses of being a premium member, they have decreased the in game money gain so everyone needs to farm. There is no reason to get mad when people pay up to $100 for a tank in a video game, it's their moeny and their choice. If this game was pay-to-win, then there would be things that only premium members can access that normal members can't. There are only 2 things that a premium member can access that a F2P member cant. Those are the extra inventory slots for your weapons, which is useless as you can only tkae a maximum of 3 weapons anyway as you cant carry too much weight. The second is an extra combat badge slot, to those who dont know what that is, you can equip 1 badge if F2P and 2 if you are a premium member, these give you small bonuses which dont affect the tide of battle. In saying that, they hardly affect a single soldiers gameplay that much, and can be countered easily with skill. All in all, don't be disgruntled by all the negative reviews from people whining about the game being pay-to-win because its really not. If you feel like you need a game to pass some time then give this a go and make your own call but dont review it after 60 hrs... Happy to answer any questions or disscuss with anyone about this game on any topic, add me for info and thank you for reading. ENJOY THE GAME",2
2015,Overall game is good. Only level up & upgrade is a problem for the players.,1

2015,This game is great. It's a ww1 fps that uses trench warfare which is very different than the standard military fps.Overall the game is very addicting and very fun. It would be amazing if they added a higher player count for awesome epic battles.i would also recommend Ro2: Heroes of Stalingrad the game is also very similar to Verdun,1
2015,I spawned in 10 minutes later found 3 friends i died was really sad...spawned in again 30 minutes later found 4 friends 1 died shortly after from a arrow to the head we all cried... so then we left 15 mins after that we found a town decided to call a airdrop than the airdrop landed and people started swamming around it enougher member died in the middle of that chaoes so we ran away and got really sad and cried then offed our selves the end.,1

2015,"This game is ruthlessly unforgiving, and equally as brilliant. It's beautiful, despite it's age, and a childhood classic of mine and anyone else who had a playstation when it's demo disc was floating around. This is gaming royalty; do yourself a favour and play it. The only PC game I can reccomend more highly is the sequel - I can't wait to see what Oddworld Inhabitants do with the New 'n Tasty reboot. 11/10. Would play again.",1
2015,"The game's great. Unless you run Windows 8. In that case ignore this recomendation, because he game crashes more often than it is entertaining - which is saying something because otherwise this game is hella fun. Very fast-paced, arcade feel. Love it.",1

2015,"This game is going to be incredible. Heck, at Version 0.08, it's already incredible. I would detail exactly why you should buy this with a lengthy review, but that would only give me less play time. So instead, I just say, buy it. I've had it for a few days and finished the available levels, and wow am I satisfied. Even without the enormous updates ahead, this builder is already worth every cent. The things you can do with the sandbox alone are worth the price tag. The levels will challenge you and force you into inspiration, and from within you a monster will come unto the world of Besieged. Nay, an army of monsters, be they flying, flaming, flipping, or f***ing exploding, they will come; and you will be bringing them to life long after the campaign is over.BUY THIS GAME. 11/selfdestructingfloatingbaloonbomberforts.",1

2015,"Knights of Pen. And Paper! I tried to be witty there.Now, I'm not one to do really large reviews, but I can tell you this: Buy this game.A ton of people will go on and on about how it sucks, how it's stupid, but it's a really fun RPG game for those that are into the genre. And a lot of people have gone on to say that it's just a time waster, but no, it's more than that. Like an RPG game, it'll take you into the story the best it can. It's up to you, if you let it do it's job or not.And as such, this took me to believe that not many people gave it that starting chance. The chance to change their lives forever.Now, you might be thinking I'm biased, and yeah, I am. I never got the chance to grow up with great games that were released on older gen consoles. Like the NES, the SNES, and even the Sega Mega Drive. I got to miss the truly astonishing ups and lows of gaming history. All because I'm a kid. So, when a game like this comes along, a game that does so well at giving the player a feel of the old world, I take it like it's a van full of candy.But, TL;DR: Buy this game if you're into the genre, you won't regret it.",2
2015,"This game, I loved it ever since I strived to get ArmA II and play it. It was emersive, beautiful. Yet, had it's downside. It doesn't limit you to be one or two things, it lets you be whatever you want. Want to travel with friends and help others? Everyone will be grateful and love you. Want to travel alone and kill everyone you meet? Then you better be skillful, as your head will have a pretty bounty. The good die quick, and the bad live forever. It's a game that makes you put yourself into the game, makes you pour your heart out into one thing. Only to show you, that games too, can be the real world.9/10, Beautiful and envoking.",2

2015,"Ok, I'll admit it. I almost gave up. I'd never given the first Witcher game a chance, and when I upgraded my GPU I thought I'd skip it and start the second instalment instead.I very nearly stopped playing at the end of the first chapter, more specifically, during the boss battle with that-other-Witcher in the game. I'm not kidding, it took me almost 30 attempts and I realised that after a whole chapter, I'd learnt very little in terms of fighting technique. For me, the game was hard. Incredibly so, not least because I'd made the mistake of not exploring enough and looking for/crafting the best gear.In the end, I persisted and the game got easier insofar as my Geralt character improved a bit. The game can be unforgiving in parts, and there is a real sense of progression when you do advance.I've finished the game, but feel I've only scratched the surface and I'm keen for another playthrough. Only this time, I think I'll give the first Witcher another go.Oh, and sex scenes.",1
2015,"Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a relatively short game--it should only take between 3 to 4 hours to complete--but the experience it offers is fantastic. The gameplay is simple in that the puzzles aren't overly difficult (although controlling the two titular characters can get confusing at first), but the world you are cast into is both evocative and mysterious. Not much is revealed about who the brothers are, or where their world resides, and I think that adds to the experience.What I loved most about the game though, was the beautiful art design. Forget about ultra high definition textures, the environment in which you play is masterfully realised and is certainly a sight to behold.",1
2015,"It's fun,Non-Rage inducing. The music is acually good and unlike some other point&click MMO's It has flower picking.I don't usually play MMO's but i will play this one (And WOW,LOL). It is not Laggy but in some cases you might lose connection but this is ALPHA/BETA Love it thats all i'm going to say",2
2015,"This game is great you should get it seeing as though its a fairly cheap game. The competitive matchmaking is A+ (amazing) casual is great and if your played cs source there are some new gamemodes such as arms race, demolition and deathmatch but again the competitive matchmaking is its top hit. So again, i repeat, GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1

1998,"It's been over 15 hours since I finished Gone Home, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since.Gone Home is a small indie title published earlier this year by the Fullbright Company, but no-one has really discovered it until about a week ago. That's when everyone started buying it, playing it, and loving it.But, firstly, let me talk about the fact that you either love this game, or you hate it. It all depends on what kind of person you are. If you are one of those guys who religiously plays Call of Duty for ten hours every single day, and only thinks a game is good if it has blood, explosions and swearing, and sex; you probably won't enjoy this game. At all. People like these can be described as ""Action Junkies"". Now, I'm not saying that all Call of Duty players are Action Junkies; not at all. But, there are some of those people out there, and the majority of them do play Call of Duty.However, I'm going to call these people Action Junkies simply because most of them don't appreciate games that don't focus on killing ♥♥♥♥, but focus on telling a more emotional story, or focus on telling a story that's designed to make the player think. All of the Action Junkies can stop reading right now, because Gone Home has none of that. It has no gore, no blood, no shooting, swearing, explosions, ect, but It's still one of my favorite games of this year. Let me explain why.Gone Home is a beautiful indie game that has conveyed the most believable and incredible emotional experience I have ever had. It blends story with design in a way that I simply can't describe. It tells a story that feels real, and true. And it all takes place in a little house for about two hours.In Gone Home, you play a young college girl called Katie who has returned home after a year abroad. However, your family has moved while you were away, and you find yourself in a brand new house. However, when you arrive, the house is empty, and riddled with clues and secrets to uncover. This is genius. Because your Katie's family has moved, Katie has never been in this house before, and the character that you're playing is just as unfamiliar with the house as the player. But, even if you're unfamiliar with the house, you're still familiar with the characters, and you still feel part of the story, because you are the other main character's sister.As gamers, we have these instincts and assumptions about games that we don't even realize. Gone Home takes all that and flips it upside-down. For example, near the beginning of the game, you walk down a dark corridor. Bam. I instantly thought that something was going to leap out at me from the shadows... But it never did. This game is NOT a horror game. However, it still has this keen sense of nervousness and uncomfort to it. Just the feeling of walking around a house, at night, while a storm rages outside, when no-one else is home, kept me on the edge the entire way through the game, especially when I had headphones on. Gone Home also places brilliant hints to scenarios, and you instantly suspect things are something they're not. For example, you eventually come across a bathtub stained with blood. However, as you explore the room a little more, you find out that it's actually not blood, but red hair dye. That then triggers an audio diary that explains the situation. It's a great way to tell a story, and I fear that it's some thing that we, as gamers, are seeing less and less of these days.As you walk through the house, you find secrets and pick up clues (Key story clues/secrets are accompanied by brilliant audio diarys). And as everything starts to add up, as everything starts to piece together, and as you start to understand what happenned in that house, you finally understand what an amazing and beautiful story has taken place while you were gone, and you finally understand what a brilliant design feat that this game is.If you ever get the chance to play Gone Home, trust me. Do it. You'll come out of it with a completely different mindset and outlook on life, and you won't get it's beautiful story out of your head for weeks. Playing Gone Home is like watching the most sad/tragic/emotional/uplifting movie ever made, but you're part of it. You are in the same place, where the other characters once were, discovering everything that has taken place in that little house.I just hope that when people play Gone Home, they play it with the right mindset and attitude. Like I said, If you play it with an attitude of an Action Junkie, you probably won't even spend the time to finish the game. But if you jump into Gone Home ready for a great story, great design, and a great game, you won't be disappointed.10/10. - Chris Walsh.",1
1997,"Overall score - 8.5/10The main reason why it's taken me so long to write this review is because I've been too busy actually playing Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor.Shadow of Mordor doesn't really bring anything groundbreakingly new to the table - apart from the nemesis system, which I'll talk about later - but it is very, very well executed. It's an action game about slaying hordes of orcs, and it does a very good job of it. A well-crafted game is something of a rarity these days, with early access titles and alphas/betas becoming more and more prominent in the industry. But when you come across a game that is just feels good to play... Wel, it's quite nice.Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a joy to play. Slicing heads off orcs is fun. It really comes down to that. It combines a fast, fluid combat system with a fast, fluid navigation system. The animations are brilliant and smooth - you can jump down and stab a dude from nearly any position - hanging, crouching, standing, ect. The gameplay mechanics, while they can sometimes be rather repedetive, are simply fun and addictive. It's one of those games where you're itching to get home just so you can keep playing that little bit longer.Shadow of Mordor also gives players a respectable measure of freedom. There are two large main areas in the game, both mildly different from each other. Many objects in this world are climbable. Talion (the ghost-ridden wraith-posessed ranger who you play as) will jump a ridiculous height - apparently because the wraith dude inside of him has cool magic and stuff - and then grab a ledge, and repeat. Talion doesn't so much as climb, as just jump and grab, jump and grab.Now, onto the nemesis system, the ""groundbreaking"" new mechanic that everyone's raving about.It's pretty cool.Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor manages to pull off two incredible feats - Number one - It makes you feel like a badass, but it also makes you feel like a vulnerable badass.Let me tell you a tale of my experience with this ""nemesis system.""I shot this one guy who was holding a crossbow in the eye with my bow, and he came back with a metal plate on his eye. The second time I killed him, I stabbed him in the stomach, and he came back with a big metal armour plate - covering his stomach. The third time I killed him, I just shot him in the back. I was rather relieved that he was dead. But, apparently, he wasn't. HE MIRACULOUSLY LIVES, AGAIN, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ just kept rattling insults at me as I slashed, stabbed and cut at his face. He had an extremely irritating trait that made him immune to my favourite tactic (leaping over them and attacking them from behind), and he was pretty much impervious to everything I threw at him, so the only way I could kill him was by getting a chain and using an execution on him. Eventully, I finished him off with a decapitation and I just kind of stood there with a look of bewilderment on my face. The satisfaction this game gives you for killing a little ♥♥♥♥♥ who's been troubling you for days (real life days, mind you) is seriously scary.But it's also why this game shines.This is the game's second incredible feat. You begin to feel an emotional connection with the randomly generated guy who you are trying (time, and time again) to kill.Or not. I've met people who couldn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about who they've killed and how. They just see the orcs as pawns, insignificant obstacles on the road to success.In conclusion, I really like this game because, quite simply, it is fun to play. The nemesis system is quite a nice touch, and makes killing orcs a little personal, if you care about that sort of thing. The story won't blow your socks off, and the combat and movement certainly aren't original creations, but everything has been integrated and implemented extremely well into a game that is fun.",1
2015,"Woah.Transistor was good. Really good.Supergiant games has somehow managed to perform the incredible feat of jumping over the already extremely high bar they set with Bastion.The Atmosphere/Visuals were 10/10. I felt drawn into the world, and I felt like it was believable. Also, the brilliantly hand-painted artwork that makes up the game world was extremely beautiful.The Music was 10/10. Wow. Ashley Barrett can really sing, and Darren Korb... well, he's a legend.The Story was 10/10. I was hooked on the story of Red throughout the entire game, all the way up until it's brilliant ending.The Combat was 9/10. Even though the combat was addictive and very well designed, some enemies and areas still felt repedetive. However, there's loads of room for replayability.Negetives: The game froze for about half a second every few minutes. It doesn't sound like much, but it really pulls you out of the brilliantly hand-crafted game world and back into miserable reality. Also, there was quite a bit of screen-tearing. It'd be nice if V-sync was an option.All in all: I loved it.10/10.",1

No, Kerbal Space Program is a suprisingly realistic Aside from the stock aerodynamic model, but  that can be fixed [forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com]  space-based flight simulator, centered on the exploration of the Kerbol system.

I have enjoyed many, many hours with Kerbal Space Program, and nevr once have I felt like I made the wrong choice to purchase this game.

2015,"Sonic Adventure DX for PC is just so, amazingly... ok. It just trys to be something absolutly huge for the franchise, mixing dramatic storytelling with the rush of Sonic gameplay, and yeah, at the time and on the right hardware, this was revolutionary. Its just plain awful today.The advancements in PC gaming make the attempts for story telling, and the technology used for this effect just laughable. Seriously, the developers of the PC version must have LOW expectations. Your first playthrough of this game (all campaigns) will be memorable for years to come, but not in a good way.  Why?Because this PC port is complete ♥♥♥. Missing button presses was a frequent problem through my experience, no matter how many different keyboards and computers I played on. (tested on 5, btw) For example, During the final boss fight of Amy's campaign, during phase 3, I game-overed 3 times from full lives because of the missed presses. In the fight, you have to jump over an obstacle. In my experience, Amy jumped probably 3/4 of the time. Eventually I got so badly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the game, I borrowed a second USB keyboard just to double my button presses.This problem was only present in the Boss fights. There is literally no reason for this.Why do I say thats its OK then? Well, Sonic Adventure DX is on the fence on being Good or Bad. The cornyness of the cinematics makes it funny and good, but only seconds later, a glitch where you are thrown uncontrolably off a stage by a pickup, losing a life and possibly game-overing you makes it bad. This effect (and unfortunatly glitch) happens frequently.If you are curious, wait untill it's like $1 in a sale before you buy. Just the hours alone and ONLY the hours alone playing this game would justify that price. If you are on the fence, just don't.Here's hoping Sonic Adventure 2 isn't this broken.",1

2015,"Color Symphony is... okay. Given a bit of polish, maybe a little bit of difficulty added, a graphics overhaul, maybe change the story a little bit (read: start story from scratch), and this would be something I'd expect to see somewhere like Armor Games, New Grounds, or Miniclip. As it is, the game has a plot that doesn't make sense, graphics and story that try to come off as edgy (and fail, hence aforementioned graphics overhaul), and a soundtrack that doesn't suit the game. On the other hand, the controls are simple and easy to master for the most part, and the colour change concept is actually pretty clever.However, it could have been implemented a little bit better. Enemies are reasonably easy to dodge, and if you hit one, you simply have to avoid it until your health regenerates, reducing the difficulty level. the erasure of multiple colours is confusing, and not needed after that tutorial level. There isn't a life system, so you can start from the start of the level as many times as you want. It also takes ages for the character to recover after being hit. Also, falling off screen is insta-death, which is annoying, as I feel like it should teleport you back to where you fell off, and reduce your health, although that would still be a slap on the wrist due to the regenerating health.So, in other words, if I was developing the game, I would not have released it yet. The price of the game is an accurate reflection of how enjoyable it is (not very, due to rather quick boredom onset). As such, feel free to have a go, but don't be dissapointed when you get bored as I did.Also, as a side note to the devs: I don't exactly know how you came up with the name of ""Color Symphony"", but the symphony part doesn't exacly fit the game.",1

2015,"This game is Guitar Hero for bad-asses.At first, taken that Bit.Trip Runner is a game focussed on rhythm, it didn't seem like much to me, just an automatic runner with a cool soundtrack right? But over time, the complexities unfolded. Each level has a few patterns of obstacles to dodge, kick and jump over. The patterns repeat over and over, a lot like a regular ol' pop song, but they're as hard as hell. I quickly learned that I would get pulverized if I didn't create patterns of my own. My natural instinct was to block the sweet tunes and the colourful scenery out of my mind, and move to my own beat.And so, the controller became its own musical instrument that I had to master. The timing with which each button was pressed carried as much weight as playing that perfect chord on a guitar. I practiced every day. Every tiny nuance in the way I played required ironing out. Pattern after pattern after pattern was formulated in my head. And after two weeks, I finally finished it, and it was the most satisfying feeling I've felt in a long time... because I felt like I was consciously engaged in creating a means to end every single level. Few games have made me feel that way before.I won't lie, at times it was one of the most frustrating experiences as well. This instrument requires precision - a fraction of a second between pressing the button makes the difference between life and death. But the anger is worth it, solely due to the fantastic art direction in the game. I was constantly inspired to get to the next world so I could see new sights, new blocky 8-bit monsters and machines that look like they could be from your worst fever dreams, vastly different, vibrant and generally awesome colour schemes, and not to mention more of that fantastic soundtrack.Playing Bit.Trip Runner is a lot like the sensation you have when starting to learn an instrument. You know it's possible to master, other people have done it before, but you know you're also in for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ times, when you feel like you just want to give up. No matter what, though, it'll always be in the corner of your eye, looking really good.",1

2015,"The Stanley parable is an awesome game all about choice. I love it, it's one of the most awesome games I have ever played and heard about. I remember the original mod and still to this day LOVE it. But there is only one little problem with this game. WE NEED MORE GOD DAMN CONTENT!! I feel the creator should really add in some new endings and lines for the narrator, but most of all, WALKTHROUGHS!!! I WANT THE DAMN WHITEBOARD ENDING!!!Anyways in the game you will be given a choice. Go with the crowd or go solo and make your own story. I really recommend to go against the system but still, do what you want to do. The game will allow it. The narrator may be sad but who cares, its just a game. The game also has lots of twist and hilariousness. I'm not going to spoil it because its such an awesome game but stanley should get is PAYDAY. (See what I did there? :D) Overall, GET THE DAMN GAME!!!",2

I cant wait for more updates and new features, one of which I hope is a bigger inventory.",2
2015,"Nether is like DayZ, in the sense of survival and trust. Only trust the people you know, such as friends or family. In Nether you fight to survive an apocolypse in witch demons have taken over. What you do is find components and food. Components for guns and food to survive. You don't create guns yourself, you get the parts and go find someone who can create them, but the guns you can create are fun. In of the sample pictures at the top of the page, you will see someone holding a can with a handle and a mark saying bullet here. This is, wierdly enough, a shotgun! A shotgun, made from a fly spray can. The things in the game are pretty basic but I hope that they add new things. Note to the creators, add in a crafting section for players to create things. I wanna create my own god damn fly spray can shotty!",2
2015,Love dungeon Crawlers? Then this is the game for you. Fight your freinds and defeat the boss. Thats it. Its quite simple but brilliant. This game is a good representation on how to fight your friends and win. This game can tear your friendship apart though. So beware of that. XD Anyway get this game. Its sale price is $10 buts its worth $100. Its so awesome and amazing! BUY IT!!!,2
2015,"Ok, this game had a good premice. Shoot zombies, monsters and robots with friends. That was a good idea. But its not a good idea if people from anywhere other than where they set up try to play. Im Australian and every single time I shot an enemy it would register and do damage. When I roll away from the Attacks, I would still get hit. This game is bad if you arent near their servers. And I don't like that. I will retract this review, as soon as Australian servers come in to this game. Until then, its a bad game for me.",2
2015,"If you like scary games and want to crap yourself, this is your game. It provides creepy antagonists and an amazing sound board. Like animotronic robots at your favourite child fast food resturaunt? Play this game and you will want to bring a bat with you every single time you go. Especialy if you work there. The story is that the robots are given a ""free roaming mode"" at night and you have to make sure they dont get out of ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizza"" A resturaunt dear to childrens hearts. When you get the job and start your work you will notice that they are moving about the resuraunt. Being the cautious person you are, you stay in your booth waiting to get out and earn your $4 per hour. On your first/second/third/fourth night you will be called by the previous night guard. He tells you a bit and say to conserve your power, this is an important feature. After that you are free to try and survive the nights as you wish.I Strongly recomend this to the people that love scary movies/games, this will make you crap yourself.""Stay the f*** away!"" ~Markiplier",2

2015,"Ok, so to start off, I have not played a lot at the time of my writing this. But I have played enough to make a review, and my overall review for this game is BUY IT! This game is awesome, it may not be the prettiest and there are still a few bugs to work out but if you want a game that can scare the crap outta you, play this.Now for my experience, I started the game and everything seemed normal enough, I picked up everything, set up some cameras and explored the map. At some point I thought ""Lets go to the night portion... biggest mistake ever! I start up the night and look through my cameras (Im not stupid enough to walk outside during night in a horror game!) and I notice that the cameras have a motion sensor. So I stupidly choose one of the lit up buttons, and witness the RAKE, not only break my camera, but also SCREAM IN MY EAR! I was so scared my heart missed a beat or two. After that I tried to scare the crap out of my friend by making him wear the headphones while I search to find the RAKE. I couldnt find him on the cameras so I head outside to hunt him. After five minutes I see the RAKE in the middle of the path and attack, missing him completely and making him run away. I try to follow but couldnt catch up, so I decide to set up a camera and run back to base. At this point my friend is hearing the RAKE running behind us and think not to tell me incase I look back.

2015,Good game,1
2015,Have had this game for a long time now and I still hold a lot of hope for it.... The progression in it's development has been disgustingly slow however.... I recommend keeping an eye on this game... As of right now it's fun to play but lacking....,1
2015,Let me start off by saying this game holds a ♥♥♥♥ load of potential. I've been a part of it for a couple years now and the lack of improvement is just sad. The game has so many bugs and errors atm that I can barely play it.Very dissapointed at the devolopers.,1

2015,"Firstly, I have experienced Deepworld for much much longer than it was on steam.Admittedly, the Steam version is a bit shoddy. That's because the game was originally on Mac and iOS and is currently in the process of being ported to Windows. (I usually play on V2 Mac.) But if you check the updates, the V3 Steam version is slowly but constantly getting better, catching up to its v2 counterpart. Additionally, some of the microtransactions mentioned in negative reviews are on the way out. There's no more skill cap and now everyone gets unrestricted access to all biomes.Anyway, I should tell a bit about what Deepworld is.Deepworld is an online multiplayer sandbox game. A notable aspect is the fact that every single server/world is linked together via world teleporters. This makes it easy to travel between worlds, to go mining, exploring, questing, building, and so on. You can build something cool and show it to your friends or the public, or you can visit other people's creations. There's a place for everything.The sandbox aspect means you can build whatever you can think of. Building materials are easy to aquire.Remember: Deepworld is always in development. It will improve over time as more content is added to the game.",1

2015,"Bioshock Infinite is absolutely amazing, the shere attention to detail and the gripping story made all the time spent looking in every corner of every random lane and fighting wave after wave of interesting (but occaisionally dull) enemies a blast and had justified the 20+ hours I have spent on this game. I found the story in the beginning a bit slow and uneventful, but the bright and glamorous world made up for that with interesting dialogue, spoken by the people lining the streets and the great showcase of the indoctrination of the people by Father Comstock. As the story/game progresses things change dramatically, throwing in plenty of combat and spicing up the story perfectly.After ruthlessly slaughtering countless numbers of enemies I found the combat got a bit dull, and in a way a bit easy after getting most of the upgrades and new weapons/vigors. The enemies are also a bit on the bland side, since most of them are just a darkish colour and little detail on the uniforms I found my self killing what I thought was the same person over and over again, this was especially prevalent towards the end of the game.The combat incorperates a lot of 'fantasy' into it, with things like Vigors and more modern guns with a little less realism and less punch. The physics of the weapons felt great too, they were not way too unrealistic but they weren't too reaslistic either, which provided a nice blend making those heads look as bigger target as always. If I were to have 1 major complaint about the guns it would be how underpowered some guns can be towards the end of the game, where I ran out of ammo for  my sniper and had only a pistol as a replacement. The pistol been my main weapon at the beginning of the game and could take down enemies in what felt like 1 blow, but the pistol had no such effect when taking down the same enemies later on, making one have to completely spray all their ammo at the opponents head to actually take them down.At the end of the story things get very weird and confusing but when the game ends, most previous events in the game begin to come together, but some do not leading to a lot of confusion and possibly sequels (?). The end left me wanting to play again, so that I can find all those little events that link to the main plot and then giggle, thinking about ""how could I have not noticed this before?""This game is one of a small ammount of games that have left me happy and satisfied at the end, and I can definately see myself playing it again sometime in the future. To get a game this great for only $10 was itself amazing. I have seen games that cost a lot more and has been realeased a lot earlier, that are absolutely terrible. Overall I believe Bioshock Infinite to be well worth the time and money, and that Irration games & 2K have done an exellent job, creating what is probably, a masterpiece. I would definately recommend getting this game, and I guarantee (A guarantee? Who has time for all that paperwork?)  you will have fun!  I give it a 10/10",1

2015,"DayZ improves upon the elements displayed in the ArmA 2 mod. It had become significantly more advanced in regards to not only the items and locations in the game but has also indured quite an extensive overhaul. The framerate is easily 100% smoother than in the mod and also seems to have been optimized better than ArmA 2. Even with the almost endless amount of content the game is still in Alpha. This means two things. First, new features are constantly being added which results in common updates. Secondly, it is broken. Now it's nowhere near as broken as some people are making it out to be and by no means is it a cash in. However there are several elements that are buggy and/or broken but that does not, at least in my case deter me from the game.If you're willing to help test the game and don't mind having to restart whenever you're killed it's definitely worth the price tag.",1

Only cons i can think of was that there is no tutorial on what each item does, some items like ball joint and such i dont know what to use for. i guess if i look at other peoples online i can see how to use them, but i'd like to see some sort of a demonstration with each part with maybe a voice over. that would be great.keep up the good work.",1

2015,"What can I say? This is one of the most addicting, challenging, awe-inspiring arcade games I have ever played. And I wouldn't have it any other way. Mono (dev) has hit the nail on the head with this one. The perfect combination of fluid, snappy motion and consistant projectiles makes controlling the pixelated 2D spaceship an absolute dream. Along with it's easy to use menu system, with simple but balanced ship customisation, it creates the type of game that is so easy to just start up, and get stuck into. Not only that but the modern arcade style visuals with dynamic feeling backgrounds and enemies makes it a very good sight for sore eyes.The feeling you get when you just beat your personal best, or absolutely dominate it by managing a score in the millions is nothing but pure acomplishment and satisfaction. At the time of writing this review I just managed to pull off a 13.7 million score run on Normal mode (just over 50 minutes of constant fast-paced action).Despite my short few hours of play time, I can already say this is an extremely well executed game and would highly recommend it to anyone who finds themselves wanting a fast-paced, exciting and beautiful game, that will surely last them a lifetime. As there is always a chance of beating that highscore one more time...",2

2008,"What a fantastic game. That's all there is to it. Rogue Legacy is a great way of easing players into the difficult retro-sidescroller-ish genre that has been popping up a lot in the indie scene. Sure, you'll die a lot. But you learn more on each death. Unlock other difficult games of recent years (Super Meat Boy, Dark Souls etc) this game forces you to adapt rather than memorise your strategies. Levels will change repeatedly, enemy layouts will change, the way they scale will change - you have to roll with the punches (heh, thanks YNAB). It took me ~15hrs to see it through on my first playthrough, and what a fun and challenging 15 hours it was. So much praise Cellar Door Games and what they've done here.",0
2008,"Ride to Hell... Ride to Hell... Firstly, putting it out there, the game's premise is half-decent - the graphics are, again, half-decent, but everything else is just such a let down.

The mouse jutters all over the gaf, analog sticks are just as jittery with some crazy acceleration behind them - then you combine driving and shooting (particularly the sidecar sections)... Hoo boy, that's, certainly something. Would I say it's the worst game I've ever played though? Nope. Dunno why, maybe it's stockholm syndrome, but it's certainly not good.",0
2015,"This game is nothing short of amazing. Definitely a game that pretty much requires a controller though, keyboard controls aren't the greatest. Would definitely recommend this, and especially as it's on sale today (2013-12-19) there's no reason not to pick this up. Hell, I bought it twice.",0
2008,"Deadly Premonition is a game unlike any other that has came out in recent years. The way in which the story grips you, the way you relate to the protagonist, the way the small town the game is set in is always alive, the... Well, just everything about this game sets it apart from the rest of the market today. The story of Deadly Premonition centres around FBI agent Francis York Morgan who is sent to the small rural town of Greenvale to investigate the tragic and mysterious death of a young girl, Anna Graham. Upon nearing Greenvale, however, he is swerved off the road and comes to in a strange place known as the “other world”. Whilst attempting to make his way out of here, York catches a glimpse of an enigmatic axe-wielding man. Eventually you escape and make your way back towards the town, it is here that the first of the colourful cast are introduced. The sherriff of Greenvale, George Woodman, and his deputy, Emily Wyatt, greet York just outside of town and provide an escort to the hotel, where work on solving this case can finally begin.It is here where the character of Zach is firmly introduced into the game, and the way in which it is done, will grip you for the entirety of the games 26 chapters. The player takes on the eponym of Zach throughout the game and is consistently addressed by York when left alone. When driving, or wandering through town, York gleefully strikes up a discussion about one of many different topics. From childhood memories and music to sharing his encyclopeadic knowledge of the film industry, there is no shortage of dialog in these moments of solitude. As mentioned earlier, however, there is quite a large and colourful cast of characters within Greenvale, each with their own story to tell and each possibly implicated in the murder of Anna Graham. From the effiminate policeman, Thomas MacLain; the potato-chip enthusiast and local doctor, Ushah Johnson or; the travelling sapling salesman, Forrest Kaysen. Each and every resident of Greenvale is memorable for their own reason, and further pulls you into the game and into the role of York. Encounters with these residents are not isolated incidents, as the world of Deadly Premonition is constantly alive. Each person lives out their lives with their own daily routine, oftentimes they can be seen passing you on the streets or hanging out at the local bar, the SWERY '65 (a nod to the developer of the game Hidetaka Suehiro, SWERY for short). As such, every moment in Greenvale feels unique, a feeling that hasn't been represented in gaming since Yu Suzuki's Shenmue for the SEGA Dreamcast in 1992. Most of the residents have their own sidequests attached to them, and the rewards for these greatly assist in completing the game, with new weapons and discount cards being just an example. These sidequests can be creative as well, from assisting Emily in bettering her abilities as a chef; helping Anna's mother deal with her loss or reorganising the store room of the convenience store. Everywhere you go, there will always be something to do or something to see, and there is almost always a benefit to exploring Greenvale. Unfortunately, this is where some of the problems of Deadly Premonition rear their head. The map provided to you can be difficult to use as it faces in the direction that York is facing when you open it. This means that if you were to check the map to see where you are going, then check again to see if you were still on the right track, the map can look completely different. The map can't be rotated once it's open and also can't be zoomed out to a comfortable level, always feeling a little too zoomed in, forcing you to learn the town's layout rather than rely too heavily on the in-game map. The layout of Greenvale isn't the only that you need to keep in the back of your mind, however. Firstly, there is a stamina meter in the game, meaning that running for too long or attacking too many times in succession can cause York to stumble around blindly for a moment whilst he catches his breath. Hunger and tiredness also play a role in the game and can be checked at any point by accessing the pause menu. Food is littered throughout town and the various “other world” levels that you venture through, and therefore isn't much of a problem. Even if you are out of food for whatever reason, there are many places in Greenvale where you can get a meal at a price. As for tiredness, this is replenished through either sleeping at various beds scattered through Greenvale, or by consuming coffee. Lastly, the game has a 24 hour timing system where certain places and events become inaccessible late in the day. You can sleep to fast forward up to 12 hours at a time, however sleeping for too long will cause you to gain hunger and also cause your clothes to need washing (yes, you read that right). The little things that you have the ability to do in the game is a small but interesting detail. Clothes can be washed, your beard can be shaved and we haven't even gotten to the driving yet. Deadly Premonition is a free roam game, but not in the same vein as, say, Saints Row. You have the ability to explore Greenvale freely and it is encouraged to do so, as such York is provided a Master Key to all the police cars in town soon after arriving (though several more cars can be unlocked later into the game). If driving at night, you can use your headlight; rain, use the wipers; need to turn, then indicate. All of these little nuances, on top of everything else mentioned earlier, cements you into the game and makes you feel as though you are York, as though you are the protagonist. A feat which is not easily achieved and one that SWERY should be commended for accomplishing.Though not all is well in Greenvale, and it is still your job to uncover what is going on. Upon progressing through the game, you learn the folklore of the Raincoat Killer. A mysterious figure who, in the 1950's, went on a murderous rampage through Greenvale; a legend that instills fear into even the youngest of its residents, resulting in a town that stands still when it rains. These are the times when York often ends up in the “other world”. These sections are filled with enemies and puzzles that must be overcome before you can return to the normal Greenvale. Hidden within these words are often vital clues to uncovering Anna's tragic death. Often the word “PROFILING” fills the screens whilst York nonchalantly lights a cigarette. This is followed by many  static images that flash before your eyes as you try and piece together what is happening in this small town. As you progress through the “other world”, these images will slowly clear up, allowing York to slowly piece together the events that occurred. Progression through these sections is slowed by a number of zombie-esque enemies known as “Shadows”. These enemies move slowly and are unarmed at first, but soon they will be wielding pitchforks and eventually shotguns. Though they aren't difficult to kill, they often respawn and, as a result, become more of a threat as a mob, rather than when taken individually. To bring them down, York can arm himself with a variety of weapons, including shovels, axes, shotguns and rifles. The combat takes the over-the-shoulder format that was popularised by Resident Evil 4, meaning that you are frozen in place whilst ever you are lining up a shot. This serves to intensify the action sequences, limiting the shots to only those that are essential so as to keep moving and outrun the shadows hunting you down.To further hinder progress, several puzzles lye in the way to solving this case. Though, unfortunately, these are never too tricky, as they are mostly explained upfront and serve more as a motivation to explore these levels rather than to test your ability.Continued...",0

It was just one of those games back then. However! The new updates and constant fine tuning has turned this game into one that still grabs my attention even after i've finished it.

Dispite the inability to run, jump or do anything other than  expore, this is a journey that is emensely complex, travelling a beautiful landscape while and going through letters being read to.

2015,"Although the first Portal was better IMO, Portal 2 is just as fun and the campaign, although quite short is still a blast. Portal 2 also has co-operative play and a easy to use puzzle maker which will keep you coming back for more. 9.5/10",2
2015,"Although this game is quite short (I finished it in around an hour and a half) it has one of the best stories of any game I've played.As I played, I learned about the Greenbriar family, and I really started to care about them. I was happy when I learned of their successes, and sad when I learned of their failures.And the way the story is told, through discovering everyday items in an everyday (though very large) house, is very unique, and effective. I discovered the characters' likes, careers, and personalities through letters and personal items. I discovered the stories of all the characters, and all were very interesting. The main story was compelling, heart-wrenching, and ulimately very- No, wait. I shan't say how it ends. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves a good story, and a beautiful game. You could probably get more time out of this game than I did if you take more time to read everything, fully explore every single room, and take in the atmosphere of the game. The regular $20 price tag is a bit steep for the time that I got out of it, and the time that most players got out of it, but if this game is on sale for $10 or less, don't even hesitate - buy it.",1
2015,"Circuits in it's basic form is a puzzle game, put the correct piece in the correct spot and see if everything looks right. However, what it does differently is every piece of the puzzle is a short piece of music, which you need to put into the correct position to recreate the whole score for the level. You might think this is quite simplistic, but if you are not a very musically driven person like me, it may be somewhat difficult to differ which piece goes where, due to some of them sounding very similar. The game slowly introduces different mechanics like layers, looping and switches, which increases the difficulty if you don't listen carefully.All in all this simplistic game is a very cheap gem on the steam store that forces you to listen to be able to solve the puzzle instead of staring and observing like many other games but can still be quite challenging and time consuming, although time is not wasted when you finally get to hear the masterpiece you put together.",1

2015," Pro's 	 A great classic must play game Something to do before Fallout 4 arrives Your not being spoon fed everything and you need to actually think your war throught the game Cons 	 A major problem with the game iss how there  WILL  be problems with it. The game was originally designed for single core coomputers, and as most computeres nowdays are at least dual, this creates a problem. There are many other problems as well, so you will have to ask Dr. Google for help until you've sorted everything out which is a faff.

2015,TRASH TEIR BUGGY AS ♥♥♥♥,1
2015,This game is worth more than it is selling for. I've played this game for years and the HD remake was even better than I expected. The AoE2 online game community is great and if I had the chance I would buy the game all over again.,1
2015,"This game is blocky, it's graphics are simple, and yet it is better in terms of content than many other games out there. The simplicity of this game is extreme and yet you find yourself still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bricks at the possiblity of someone with a scoped gun might kill you and take all your stuff. The zombies are easy once you know how to take them down but the hunger, thirst, sickness and blood makes the zombies that little more feared. The island is vast with resources and although the view may be an eyesore at first, it still gives you a feel of a real post-apocalytic world.Totally recommend it",1
2015,"I got this game for about 50 cents, and it wasn't even worth that.You may think that this game is one where choice actually affects the story, it doesn't. No matter what you choose, you will continue to do the same crap and visit the same places. You will still go through the final act and see the same stuff, the only difference will be the very end scene.The only effort put into the game was the art and it's just a bunch of stills. The programming is the equivilant of a 10-year-old script kiddie. I would only reccomend this game if it was free",1
2015,"WHERE HAS THIS GAME BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?I was hooked on this game from the first ten minutes of playing. The gameplay is intense, it leaves you thinking of up to three or more future moves. The multitude of equipment and augmentation gives this game a great feel and want to repeat the game all over again. It is an almost unforgiving strategy game and it gives a thrill that many games just don't.The maps are randomly generated and give a feeling that although some rooms are almost similar, the placement of the rooms make this game endlessly playable.This is my only criticism and I am aware that improvement on storyline is planned but at the moment it is very bare. You aren't really motivated by any larger goal and you aren't sure what the agency really is at all.I would recommend this game to anyone and keenly look forward to further additions.20/10(Would rate higher if I could)",1

2015,"An adrenaline-fueling yet funny game, where you are being hunted by an army of Gentlebots. You have to get machine pieces and bring them back to where you start to repair a teleporter as your butler, Mr Walters, talks to you. As you get more pieces, more and new, tougher robots come. You have a hunger meter, so you have to scavenge for food in the houses that lay around. At first, your only tools of dealing with the robots are bottles that you can throw to distract them (they don't hurt them) and alarm clocks that you can set to go off - up to 60 seconds of delay. Although, you might find some weapons that will be of use - the hatchet, the pistol, the shotgun, the rifle and even a blunderbuss! All the time, you will have to deal with a Tetris-like inventory. It runs on the Unity Engine, so it is not that intensive: but don't expect great graphics.The game is still in development, so new robots, biomes and items are being added.A definite recommendation.Oh, and may I add: Sir, You are being Hunted.",2

2015,"The Binding of Eye SacA game about a baby whose tear-ducts are so enflamed due to the hardship of his former life, that he sets out into his own basement in order to retrieve a packet of eyedrops that he was given as a christening present.Unfortunately, little does he know, his eyedrops are guarded by the forces of hell (among other things), making it rather difficult for poor Eye Sac to get them back. There's even a giant hairy leg that just so happens to be the true guardian of the eyedrops. It's a bit like that Goron in Ocarina of Time that needs eyedrops because he's been snacking on a few too many delicious Goron ""onions"", but far more dark and depressing.",1
2015,"It's not often I care much about the graphics of a game - being a Nintendo gamer and all, gameplay often comes first (as it should). But this game? This game has changed my opinion.Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons has such a beautiful art style, like Fable: that realistic yet slightly cartoony look. The game is filled with an array of warm colours, gorgeous lighting and an absolutely HUGE sense of scale. Playing as the two brothers in such a lonely yet amazing set of environments, you feel absolutely dwarfed by the sheer scale of it all. This is saying a lot - but I'm going as far as to say this visually looks more impressive than Okami, which if you've played you'll know is one of the best looking games despite its age.Coupled with a superb, chilling soundtrack and a completely unique single-player co-op gameplay style; this is seriously the perfect game. Two hours in and I swear this is game of the year material, if not one of the best games I've ever played if it continues the way it's started.This had better win a multitude of indie game awards. People NEED to play this.",1

2015,"Most depressing game? Quite possibly.Darkest Dungeon is a game I only recently discovered, and I'm very glad I did.An incredibly punishing game that should please masochists the world over - Darkest Dungeon combines a variety of gameplay elements spanning several genres, and heavy influence from Lovecraftian mythos with dark gothic themes.Playing as somewhat of an RPG/DnD/adventure/roguelike hybrid, the game focuses upon building a party and completing quests through side-scrolling exploration riddled with turn-based strategy for combat. This may sound fairly stock-standard, but the added element of ""stress"" adds a layer of depth unlike any I've seen in a game.Each character has a set amount of HP. Simple? Yes.Each character has a set level of stress at any given point in time. Simple? Not quite.Actions while questing, fighting, resting and returning to town in-between quests will all have an impact on a character's stress; this is what turns an otherwise fairly simple RPG into a challenging, punishing experience of a game. Once stress level on a character hits 100, they turn insane: acting irrational, spreading stress among party members, attacking of their own accord in battles. This is exactly what you want to avoid. I could go on about Darkest Dungeon for several pages, but that would simply be detracting from the amount of time you could be spending actually playing it. Though early access (at this moment), it's easily worth the purchase and will have you cursing for hours on end as your party members trudge through dungeons, are faced with insanity and eventually perish.Buy this game.",1
2015,"I recently started and finished The Vanishing of Ethan Carter in a single sitting, and was thoroughly impressed the entire 4.2 hours it took me to fully complete the game.Although very short (and possibly too short for the full price of the game), TVoEC offers a simplistic yet incredibly engaging game. Taking inspiration from early 20th century weird fiction (namely H.P. Lovecraft, as expected), the story revolves around a private eye on a mission in an isolated village to help one ""Ethan Carter"". While playing through the opening segment, it seemed quite similar to Dark Corners of the Earth (also available on Steam, but broken as all hell) - being dumped in a disturbing setting with next to no guidance, only to figure everything out for yourself. This minimalist style of gameplay definitely works in the game's favour, as it seems to allow for a more immersive experience. There is no HUD, health bars, maps or quest icons. You have the WASD keys, the mouse, and your own two feet.Gameplay revolves around solving various puzzles, and entering the minds of those deceased to see memories shortly before their deaths. It feels slightly cliche, but isn't too over-the-top like you might expect. The game's story is unravelled through these various puzzle sequences, as you explore the village in which the game is set, learning of the characters and their relationships with one another. It's definitely not an in-depth story, but it is very engaging.Where TVoEC really shines is in its atmosphere. From the very first minute of the game, the atmosphere of this game almost smacks you in the face with how incredibly immersive it is. The stunning environments, beautifully-composed soundtrack and occasional narration from the main character provide an incredible feeling of isolation as you make your way through an empty and run-down village. It's almost unlike any game I've ever played, and has to be played to fully understand.I picked the game up off the Humble Store for $6.66 (coincidence?) and felt very satisfied with my purchase. For the RRP of $19.99 it may seem like a bit much for a game that can be finished in a few hours, but for anything ~$10 or less it's definitely a must-have for fans of mystery, horror, and weird fiction.",1
2015,"You've heard of heroin and cocaine, but have you heard of Clicker Heroes?The pure embodiment of addiction in video game form - this game is absolutely pointless, but you won't be able to stop playing it for some strange reason.

2015,"Despite how the other reviews are saying it's a bad game, I really loved it.The graphic style was ever so unique that I was drawn to the game. I'm a person who doesn't usually cry at the end of games, but I got attached to these characters - I learnt so much about these characters and about their backstories that each outcome left me sad. This game really left an impact on me because this relates to my home life too, as a child I found myself like Tommy in multiple ways and the surrounding characters were too similar to be comfortable at times.The ending of the game was a bit abrupt in some ways but ever so touching, I actually got watery eyes in the end. I felt like I had made the right decision for the family, even though one of them was hurt in the end.Overall, I really liked this game, although since it left an imprint on me, I wouldn't be able to play it again. I highly recommend it to people who suffer from SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder), or low depression. 8.5/10 :)",1

It is simple beautiful - there are points in the game where you should just admire the scenery; even though it's not real, it's simply beautiful.HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!",1

These puzzles include the use of jumping/gliding, explosives, grappling hooks, slowing time and portals. The first part of the game you will be also doing a few cool arenas with different objectives such as aerial kills and protecting zombies.Bosses are really fun and have really cool mechanics, if you liked raiding it WoW I would defiantly recommend thisThere are only a few bad things I can say about this game. I found some with lots of crashing and buggy achievements/hand ins. You may also require a controller as it is a port.",1
2015,"This game is Amazing, I cannot express how much I love this game. I have completed it twice and thinking of doing it a third for the rest of my achievements. It is on my top 10 favourite games. BUY IT NOW!Without being biased it is an overall fantastic game. It combines addicting third person action gameplay with fantastic voice acting to make it a perfect comedy. I caught myself laughing out loud a few times (This is very hard to get me to do). Also, it has in my opinion one of the greatest soundtracks I have heard in a long time.It does have a story that carries on from the other two games, but you don’t need to know anything about the others to enjoy the third (I started out with Saints Row: The Third). This game, however doesn’t take itself seriously. This is what makes the game rather than breaks it.Some people however like to compare this to GTA, but in my opinion the only thing that is the same is the fact you can steal cars.9/10DLC - I recommend buying the Trouble With Clones And Gangstas In Space, these both add a great new storyline that will take a while to finish (The Genkibowl VII DLC only adds around 4 new activities and a few new costumes, I honestly wouldn’t recommend spending the extra money)The others however only add cosmetics/new weapons that don't really add much to the game.I completed the game and all achievements on 9/04/2015 with 93 hours played",1

2015,"A hidden gem buried in the F2P section,though this game has been put on hold by the developers due to financial reasons,and is currently receiving no updates .This game's future remains unclear,and now is largely supported by its community who loves the game.This game is good,but has the potential to be much much better if it receives some polishing,like removing bugs and exploits,and reworking the shop and item system.It is a 3rd person fighting game,with its playstyle consists of dragon nest and street fighter crossover.Each character has its own unique combo,and pros and cons as well.A larger portion of the players are veterans at this game,so it may be frustrating for some newer players getting their asses handed to them,but once you read up some guides and get familiar with the game that is where the real fun starts.For those dragon nest and street fighter lovers this game is worth a shot,since it has elements from both games.As I said again,the game is currently receiving no updates meaning it might get stale for some players,but there are different characters to try out and master as well.Casual players are welcome as well,this game is really good at killing your boredom.",1

It has some bugs and issues. The music in this game is amazing 10/10. i saw alot of people hating on the voice actor and i feel bad for him because i actually enjoyed his voice alot. The plot twist is amazing and the fast pased intence monents are fun, expecially the one where you only have 60 seconds to escape i loved that. all in all i really like the game and i admit its not living up to Portal2 but this game is still fun but would be better if you didnt have to purchase it, kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥. 7/10",1
2015,Currently one of my favourite games purely because of its intense story. The only downside I would have to this game is that the episodes don't come out soon enough for my liking but I still love the moment new episodes come out none the less.,1
2015,Bloody Brilliant! Get it!,1
2015,REALLY BIGSKY-REWIEW-Indie Retroooo-Old retro nes galaxy game waiting for us and this time indie devolopped it-Great explosion effects in Galaxy -Different Bosses to defeat-Great sound and music in entire stagesTry to get your best score but you need to know you can't get high score without upgrade your ship -So is it worth to buy it?Yea it's worth to buy it for indie game and retro/nes lovers,1
2015,SUPER DISTRO-REWIEW-Hardest Platform Game Ever!-This game is really bad in opinion because stages are too much hard because of bad stage designes-Controls are really bad you can just press move inputs and jump fire button and it's not enough to finish stages So if there would be any double jump button or auto health regen or like that something that would be better-Hardest Platform Game in my opinion and almost impossible to finish the game it's not fun!-So is it worth to buy it? Nope Exacly Nope..,1
2015,"Read no further reviews about it, and spoil nothing for yourselves. Play it and be immersed. It is a definite must play.",1
2015,"Multiplayer gameplay:1.) Port forward - Google on how to get this done, and with a static IP, you should have no issues hosting a game.2.) Hamachi - Easier than port forwardingThe game captures the essence of a crafting survival adventure gameplay which is surprisingly addictive. Even at this stage of development, there are minimal bugs; very unlike other alpha / early access games. Great range of biomes, though it would be better if there were more classes. Overall a great game.",1
2015,Addictive and fun!,2
2015,Worth the time and money... 9.5/10,2
2015,"Gra niesamowita! Lepsza od swojego powszednika. Grafika niesamowita, grywalność wspaniała, a muzyka i różne dźwięki typu strzał kulą powala. Mnóstwo komedii, niektóre misje w różnych procentach związane z jakimś filmem...Grafika - 9,5/10Grywalność - 9/10Dźwięk - 9/10Ocena Końcowa - 9/10",0
2015,"Całkiem przyzwoita gra. Śmieszna, ciekawa, prosta, i nie zanudza. Jedynie mnie bawi - jak to się stało że to się dostało to na Steam? Okej - gra za darmo, pozytywnie ją oceniam, ale takie ""wow"" totalne.Grafika nie ma nic tu do życzenia, to samo z oprawą dzwiękową. A historia bawi, i jeszcze śmieszne rozmowy. Spodobało mi się gra z kucykami, gdyż miała w sobie odrobine logiki, to samo z grą platformówką gdzie skaczesz jakimś prostokątem (tutaj skojarzyło mi się lekko z Thomas Was Alone)Innymi słowem: Gra na nudny wieczór warta rzuczenia okiem, przynajmniej na te ponad 30 minut, może nawet mniej. Nie ma zbytnio tam nic do roboty, jedynie trudzenie się z dwoma-trzema podgrami które były w ""Dev Guy"".Jak już mówić o ocenie, to dam to w formie oceny literkowej jak w szkołach w USA czyli: B+.B+ gdyż może i gra fajnie zrobiona, przyjemna, ale jakoś taka krótka, (30 minut, może nawet więcej plus jeszcze napisy to serio dość krótko) za mało w sobie ma, (mam na myśli że chodzi sobie typ, zbiera dane, hakuje czyjeś profile czy Bóg wie co, i gra w dziwne gry, najbeznadziejneszą grą było pewnie jak dla każdego klikanie strzałki żeby wejść do pokoju gdzie znajduje się głupie pudełko - WTF) zdziwiło mnie też to że ta gra została zrobiona na Unreal Engine, a nie na przykład na Unity, ale za to ocena skoczyła w śmieszny sposób do B+. Graficznie nie pogardzę, muzycznie przyjemnie (wkurzało mnie jedynie jak przechodziłem z pokoju na pokój, gdzie musiałem przyciszyć dzwięk gry w ustawieniach Windows). I czy polece tą gre? A w rzeczy samej - polece.",0

2015,"This in fact, was what i am looking for.",1
2015,"This Game Is Terrible. the gameplay is terrible and multiplayer is impossible because there is no possible way to find friends, it is entirely unfriendly to new players who get shot down just so the more experienced can steal their torches and in my very honest opinion I feel as though I should get a refund with the included terrible quality of the game for 20 dollars.",1
2015,"finally got 100% on this game, I would highly recommend the game, has an amazing and unique graphical style even those who aren't fans of the series can pickup the game quickly and enjoy gameplay that never seems to get boring with such an exciting pace",1
2015,Loved the singleplayer (give it a 10-10 and 8-10 for storyline) but i never finished coop so im looking for some random beginner who wants to play coop with me but you need skype,1
2015,love it recommend it to anyone who likes games like this!,1
2015,Buy this now,2
2015,"Honestly, this may be my new favourite PC game. I picked it up on sale a few months ago and I haven't found this much enjoyment in a game since Kingdom Hearts II. It has a good story that isn't too in depth, funny charecters, good map creation, too many guns to count, great RPG elements, a good range of charecters and four player co-op. For $10 this game is a complete steal and if you have the money I definately recommend the GOTY edition.9.5/10",2
2015,very fun game u must play it or i will punish ur ♥♥♥ ;),1
2015,"The story is compelling enough to keep you going, the conbat does get a bit repetitive at times though, but still there's so much put into the game that it's easy to overlook the problems.",1

2015,muito bom,1
2015,"Fantastic story and puzzles, deffintly have the hooks in to the end.",2
2015,"This game has a lot of potential,however we are limited to only controlling our main hero and not other units.So,I decided to train more troops and let my hero stay clear from most battles,this led me to losing the match.When you are outleved by your enemy more 2 levels,dont even try to play,just surrender if you can.This is because no matter how hard you try,if the enemy hero is the same as you but 2 levels higher,you cant win the fight.The units counter each other but in the endgame many units are rendered useless as there is the artillery tower that insta-kills axe men and archers.You also can screw up very easily in this game,if you do,just surrender for christ sake as your units stumble their way through the lane,dying and feeding the enemy hero.The player count is also extremely low as I played with the same person for 5 times,and he is of higher rank than me,so that makes my beginners experience extremely poor.The controls are confusing at first,but once you get the hang of it,you're fine.The fullscreen option is bugged as it does not correctly fit my monitor screen.The conclusion is,this game is fun,loads of fun.Being an early access game,I can see this game improving more and more.I hope to see more upgrades to the towers and more unit types to add to the variety of the game as a whole.",1
2015,:D Love this game,1
2015,"Great game, and an awesome example of rogue-like games, would be much better with more modding tools available.",1
2015,"An excellent little game that should take between an hour to an hour and a half to finish.  It's a fairly simple puzzle game that goes from quite simple to complicated (at around level 37 if you're playing and wondering when its going to get hard) (insert obligatory ♥♥♥♥♥ joke here). Very nice game that you should definitely drop a buck on. The puzzles are very intriguing in a 'if I press a button, how do I only move what I want' and are usually quite challenging in a neat way. Some of the later levels get a little convoluted and I found myself having more problems understanding the puzzle than I did solving it. All the mechanics are simple to understand and typically have one introduced every 4 levels or so, apart from one point where you have 2 more difficult mechanics introduced in following levels which is when the difficulty ramps up, would've like 3 or 4 levels inbetween to truly make the most out of each,Only a few small things that affect gameplay in no way. First, theres no menu or ability to edit noise volume (that I saw anyway). The music is nice, but I would've preferred just to have rainymood.com going in background. Secondly, a Level selection option seems mandatory in a game like this, but the only option is to go through levels one by one, even if it is a single playthrough sort of game it can be exasperating, I was hoping to look back on simpler times by level 46 and found I'd have to go level by level, no thanks.Well worth the slight thinking induced haze im in right now9/10, buy this game its only a dollar",1
2015,Would reccommend to anyone who fancies colliding galaxies,1
2014,Great game but short. Buy on sale or somewhere not for full price. I paid $5 for it and was satisfied.,2
2015,Pretty much dead multiplayer. The campaign is fun the first time around but the achievement system is broken.,2

2015,"Pra quem ama uma boa história.Baseado no estilo de jogo point'n click e na HQ, a história do jogo é uma das melhores que eu já vi, melhor até que muitos filmes por aí.Oferecendo um mar de emoções, o jogo permite que você decida por onde seguir, ou o que fazer. Você é livre, porém cada atitude tem uma reação que assim, formará a sua história. São cinco episódios, e cada episódio tem cerca de duas horas. Cada episódio mais emocionante que o outro. Até o mais ogro dos ogros vai acabar se comovendo em algum momento. Quando você pensa que tudo vai ficar bem, acontece algo totalmente inesperado e te deixa de queixo caído. Por isso, espere pelo melhor se preparando para o pior.O jogo é mais do que 10!",0

2015,1/10... Steam has really low standards letting this game be released. The first game of 2015 i've played on steam is low. Atleast i'll appreciate other games much more this year. This game is more like a very early in development tech demo. I bet this game was made the night before released. Maybe the dlc will explain the gameplay. Just maybe. Anyway i'm a bit harsh 1.5/10 for a tech demo and 1/10 for a game.,1

Do I look like a rocket scientist? ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥ right here in particular. If I wanted to play a game that involves thinking, I would just go back to TF2 and calculate the trajectory of rocket jumping.

2015,"I tried to play many other MOBA's - tried to get into them and understand what the hype was - to no avail. When I read about this game being a 3rd person with more control over the way you attack I was willing to give it a go. I was highly surprised and now I'm highly addicted to this game. Sometimes when you take a different approach you get it right, and you account for those of us like me, who didn't like the original way it was done.",1
2015,this game is like a day Z + minecraft/ roblox gamewhat i mean by that is that the game is blocky but has DayZ features that are includedthe game is creative and is fun because if you like surviving from zombies then this is the type of game for you,1

2005,Very fun especially with friends. Can be a bit boring without. Other than that like minecraft but with tons of mods and round objects. Not that thats a bad thing of course. Space engineers is a minecraft-like building sim but in my opinion.  A hell of a lot more fun. Would recommend to all people who like space.

2015,"<BEFORE REVIEW NOTICE> Played about 100-200 hours on the browser before the steam release and am only just now getting round to this review because i havent quite been bothered enough<BEGIN REVIEW :P> Positive: This game is great. If only i could end it like that but there is so much more to say. The game itself is like if insurgency and battlefield had a child which decided to become free. (No mum, this is my ART!). To begin with the community is great, at least in Australia/Oceania. I've only encounted a few toxic squeakers and have made it my person mission to eliminate them repeatedly.The guns are really fluid and I like the semi-realistic take the developers have taken on. With most rifles and smg's requiring 2-3 bullets to kill.The maps are fun to play and encourage teamwork and make for some great moments with or without friends. New guns every month or so. Negative: Optional buy-in credits of some sort. Really quite optional, as mentioned before pretty much every gun does 2-3 bullet kills. (Snipers obviously less)Sometimes struggle to actually get into the game, keeps saying ""installing plug-in, please wait"" for about 10 minutes but as mentioned before, once you get into the game you can easily forgive it.Well thats pretty much it. Hope this helped you make a decision. In the end though, its free, its fun and a good time waster 5/7 would spend 20 minutes writing a review for again.",1

2015,"Honestly one of the best games I have ever played, The story line was magnificent, the atmosphere, it all drew you. However the constant changing view points have resulted in my death in the game quite a bit, nonetheless magnificent scenery and captivatng story. The gameplay was a bit shakey but very wonderful, leaping through the air from beam to beam tends to exite someone, and this game created that feeling.  The addition of the sidescroller prince of persia minigames was excelent.There were a few issues with playing on steam however, I noticed that it lacked the ability to ""shift+tab"" while in game. The ability to ""alt+tab"" still remains however it is a tedious thing to tab out of a game for the purposes of a message.I did enjoy the soundtracks but there were some moments where it would not play during a fight and then start again at random intervals. Nonetheless this did not make the fighting less intense.In summary a very well made game, it is astonishing to believe it has really been ten years since I have played it on the ps2.I recomend this game for anyone who likes a good story over graphics.",1

2015,"This is going to be a mixed review, however I will recommend it for EXPERIENCED or VETERAN MOBA players. If you are starting out in the MOBA scene, this is not really the game for you, sorry, it's simply just not polished enough for people beginning in the world of MOBA's.I don't have a whole lot of experience with this game so far, but I have clocked literal hundreds of hours on LoL and DotA 2, so I do have MOBA experience. Positives:- Personal Courier System: a really interesting idea that I think works well, and helps focus the combat on killing heroes and creeps/minions/brawlers (from now on will be referred to as brawlers), and not on looking out for couriers to earn some extra gold.- Recipe System: A really cool idea that allows you to change the components that make-up a recipe, thus giving you different stats, but still what the weapon is supposed to do.- Pets: Another interesting idea, that provides a little bonus for your hero, and aren't too overpowered or take away from the obverall experience- Last-Hit System: Playing and looking at the demo-videos of Strife it is obvious that they have purposely designed this MOBA to minimise toxicity between players, not only through community (Like LoL) but also through core game components and mechanics, I feel that this works really well, and benefits everyone.- Constant Stream of Heroes: This is both a positive, and a negative (which will be brought up later). Not much to be said, the more the merrier right?- Waiting for Loaders: When waiting for other loaders you are placed in the game. Your hero/champion cannot move, but they can level their chosen skill and purchase items from the shop. I like this as it makes waiting for others a little less boringNegatives:- Towers: I think every review has covered this, towers are horrendously overpowered. seriously. in League or DotA its possible to tower dive for about half a minute or so to secure an enemy kill, but in Strife, the moment you attack and enemy hero under their tower you are targeted (this is ok), but the towers hit like a truck. for the whole game. Fully levelled people are still scared of those damn things. This needs to be fixed. ASAP.- Constant Stream of Heroes: Unfortunately the constant stream of heroes is also a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. With a large amount of new heroes, the ones already in the game cannot be refined fast enough, and there are some glaringly obvious heroes/champions with OP abilities and such.- Penalty for leaving: You can't play another game until the one you left is over. Yup. Thats it.There are probably a whole bunch of things that I've missed about this game, but on the whole I enjoy it as a refreshing take on the MOBA scene.Misc Things:- No AU servers: This obviously only affects AU players, but a constant ping of 200-300 is kinda annoying.- No all chat: I just can't find it, maybe it doesn't exist, probably due to the anti-toxic community take the team are going for.Overall, to conclude, I would say that this game is what it is. Early Access, BETA. Its a pretty cool and new take on MOBA, but its still early access, and needs some (or a lot of) work. If you enjoy MOBAs and know your way around them, give this one a shot, I think you'll like it for what it is. If you are new to MOBAs and are looking for one to start off with? Give this one a miss until you have more experience, simply because I think you'll have a better experience with other MOBA'sNow this is all my exerience with the game, with a measly 10 hours under my belt, thanks for reading guys-Glitch",1

2015,"Though simple, the art style and animations are absolutely beautiful. Having this helps when youre staring at the same thing for how many hours  due to dying so much. The soundtrack compliments the game as well, and though freaking difficult, you still wanna play more and more.The controls are simple and not complicated whatsoever. With very few buttons you're able to do a range of diferent attacks. Though i have to admit, on multiple occassions i had attempted to, say, just do a quick punch, though what happened was a quick dash - ultimately leading to my death. Whether it be into a pile of spikes or off the ledge. It just adds to the difficulty of the game, though usually is no problem.There a different factors of this game that remind me of Super Meat Boy, and both games are great. Got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at both, but nevertheless, theyre still really fun. I'd recommend this to anyone up for a challenge. Youre going to die whilst playing this game. A lot. But no matter how many times you may, or how angry you get, its all worth it. If you're a sucker for platformers, definitely pick this up. Have fun dying!",1
2015,"im not gunna lie, im a bit addicted to this game xDI recommend this to anyone and everyone, it's really fun to play with you friends and people online.I really enjoy the rankings, gives people something to aim for (instead of just aimlessly playing over the same maps over and over, however i'd be fine with that ;3 ) It's great how you give players the opportunity to create levels and have the chance to be featured for others to play.I would suggest maaaayybeee creating a couple more official maps? Just because during the ranked matches, i prefer to stick to the maps i know well (the official ones), and replaying them can get a little bit boring. not complaining though, just a thought :)the only two things i think need fixing are the few bugs in the game. sometimes the camera is set completely away from all players- this can go on till the game ends, or just for one or two rounds. Rarely happens, but can get quite annoying when playing in ranked matches. Also, happening once or twice, my player randomly flew off the screen, causing me to die.The other thing, which is a lot less of a problem, is upon opening the game, the window is opened half on-half off my screen. Not sure if i'm the only one, but it's happened on both of my computers. overall great game, you should deffinitely have a play of this when you can!",1
2015,"this is a great game, i enjoyed every bit of it. If you ever have the chance to playit, please do. Theres about 1-2 hours gamelpay depending how much you explore for things and such. I love the story, i'd definitely play through this game again just to relive the events.really glad this was on the humble bundle",1
2015,"This is a great game, even though quite short, i loved it. The story was sweet, and i've gotta admit i got a lil bit emotional when it neared its end. A Bird Stoy is similar in many ways to To The Moon, though TTM is both loonger, and had more of the player controlling it. If you have played/seen To The Moon, deffinitely buy this as well, or at the very least watch someone play it.",1

2015,"Planetside 2 is an immense game. Everything about it is huge. The maps, the battles, the bases. An all-out battle between anywhere up to 100 people is commonplace here, aircraft swooping in, raining death, as tanks roll through, pounding huge shells at their enemies. So as you can imagine, starting into it you can easily be overwhelmed! I started with very little knowledge of how the game worked, and slowly over time I've learned to do well at it.Starting off, you choose your gender and faction, and are immediately dropped at the warpgate for your faction. This is basically home base, and as far as I know no enemy combatant has ever got in. There are three continents you can go to, and you access these with the consoles with the globe, right in front of your spawn. There's a desert continent, a jungle and an ice continent. They all feature the same objective-based capture the base gameplay, the only difference is aesthetic.Your default guns starting off are actually rather good. The upgrade system allows you to grind a bit to make your guns shoot harder, be more accurate and controllable, and to upgrade your armour and abilities. Sink enough hours into it and you can even afford a different gun!Vehicles are a focal point of this game. The Sunderer is a heavily-armoured APC that serves as a very useful mobile spawn point, and using one tactically can change the tides of a battle. There are tanks you can use too, as well as light 4x4s and buggys. Aircraft are also available, but it's worth putting in a LOT of training before using these, as they are expensive and hard to master.Though the game has no tutorial, it's worth noting that you can access VR Training through the continent console. Here you can try out vehicles, weapons, and so forth without having to spend any money. It's a great way to try before you buy, and removes the risk of spending your hard-earned cash/points.I higly recommend jumping in and giving it a go. Let yourself die a lot, get in the groove, and eventually you'll start to learn how to play the game, the ins and outs of it. Deaths don't matter here, it's about making a difference as much as possible. Medics and engineers are just as important as the front-line gunners and the snipers, and I speak from experience as I usually run as a medic or a heavy. Medic-ing is probably the most fun, as you find yourself doing a lot of heroic sprints through fire to save your teammates, healing them and then laying down fire with them. It's great for a run-and-gun type of person, and the default weapon gets very accurate and powerful as you sink more points into it.Planetside 2 is challenging, well-balanced, with great gameplay, tight controls, and solid-feeling weaponry. The most amazing thing is that it's absolutely free to play, with no pay-to-win at all. I'd recommend it to anyone who's sick of the meaningless grind of COD and wants to accomplish something bigger. There's no better feeling than battling for more than an hour to capture a huge enemy base, working side-by-side with real people as a perfect team.YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE NOT TO TRY THIS GAME!",1
2015,"While it does feel a bit like just a massive Borderlands 2 DLC, there's enough fresh stuff in there to merit a decent look. Definitely reccomend it, especially if you loved Borderlands 2.",1
2015,"Great experience, gives insight to how people of different generations' perceive reality. At this point, it isn't very long only taking about a maximum of 10 minutes.

2015,"To put it bluntly, Broken Age is fantastic.The game is a classic point-and-click adventure, in the vein of the Lucasfilm Classics. For those of you who have been living under a rock for two years, Broken Age (previously known as Double Fine Adventure) was a huge kickstarter success, finishing up with over 3 million in crowd-sourced funds. Being one of the original big Kickstarter projects, there was some worry, but Double Fine pulled through in the most stylish way possible.The game is split into two parts, which is.... split into another two parts.This is a review of Act 1. Act 2 will be released some time this year, and here's hoping it's as good as this act. In each act there are two tales to play, both incredibly different, but linked in many, many ways. In one, you play as Vella, a girl forced into tradition. In the other you play as Shay, a boy forced to stay in a spaceship his whole life. Both stories are incredibly fun to play. On your first playthrough you may not notice the similarities between the stories, but if you think about them and put the events together in your mind, you realise how linked these tales are. I can't describe the amazing feeling I had when I discovered these connections. I can't really describe them without completely spoiling the game though.The gameplay is what you would expect from any adventure game. It's fun, puzzling and satisfying. The only downfall is the sheer simplicity of the puzzles. I only really got stuck on one puzzle and even then it's because I just didn't notice one item amongst the background. However, this is actually a pro for younger gamers, as they will enjoy it without getting frustrated.The art. Oh man, the art. It's gorgeous. I can say no more, just look at the screenshots.The music is fantastic as in most Double Fine games. Some great peaceful, ambient tunes to relax you as the gears in your head grind.The story is obviously great, with some excellent writing. The biggest caveat in adventure games for me is feeling bored as lines and lines of text go on and on. In this game though, I was always interested, clicking on every dialogue option available. The AAA voice acting helps a lot too. Before you ask, yes, Jennifer Hale is in it.Overall, Broken Age is a must-buy. Generally I don't preorder or buy games at launch, I just wait for a sale. But this time I did and it was worth every dollar. The length may be an issue, but for me just Act 1 was worth the purchase, but with another act on the way, there's really no reason not to buy this ASAP. What more can I say? Brilliant art, music, puzzle design, writing, voice acting.... It all helps to make this a great, great game. Do yourself a favour and pick this up. You won't regret it.",1
2015,"Borderlands 2 is an immeasurably fun experience, from the four different classes to the varying, beautiful landscapes, it certainly brings the world of Pandora to life. The humour of the game is perfectly interwoven into the story and gameplay, as it is used rather subtly and appropriately, as if actual people were making the jokes and not characters from a sitcom. Ridiculous characters make ridiculous entrances, and serious moments are reacted to appropriately by all.""Man, this is one of them moments..... CATCH A RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDE!""The game has a massive variety of enemies throughout the world that contribute to the believability of Pandora, as each area has creatures to fit the theme of the map. Though at times the enemies can feel a little unfair, as Threshers can come out of nowhere to hit you for big damage, Stalkers will hunt you down relentlessly and Spiderants are just plain unavoidable. Though this doesn't retract massively from the excellent gameplay that has been laid down.Overall, the fighting works well, each character has their own unique quirks and backstory, and every passing line in the game feels as if the characters was actually speaking to you. Again, the humour in this game is fantastic, and aids in setting up the world of Pandora amazingly.",1
2015,"Brilliant game, difficulty not too high not too low, BEAUTIFUL scenery, absolutely gorgeous graphics, although sometimes the collectibles can be really really really tricky to find as you need a decoder to do so. But still, definitely buy this, fantastic.9/10",1
2015,"Fantastic game, wonderfully designed to match the features of Portal 2 but makes it extremely more difficult. While the story is definitely set out well and Virgil, the new core, is a joyful addition to the game this can often be undercut by the difficulty of the game, as it will often take vigorous methodical work to even get close to an answer for a course that is something you wouldn't even consider as it goes against the puzzle solving mechanics of the original two games.However, the voice-acting, interactions with Virgil and the very pleasant old timey feel of the game helps to push you through it, and at a total of zero dollars makes for an enjoyable journey through the old Portal universe that you've been missing for four years. I would definitely recommend it for those who've been waiting for Portal 3, as it may be the closest we'll ever get, but maybe not for those with short patience, as it is definitely a game of hard thinking.The ending is superb, it has a beautiful soundtrack, Virgil is a splendid character to take you on the adventure and in the end the game just FEELS like a new Portal game. It is fantastically well done and fantastically difficult.",1
2015,"Holy crap, what is there to be said about this game? How on Earth do I explain how utterly mind-melting it is without spoiling the most freakish and complex components of the story?Well, for one thing, the game starts you off with a very simple rules; Time only moves when you do, and red guys are the baddies... or are they???Superhot, or, rather, SUPERHOT makes you question yourself again and again as you go deeper and deeper into the levels. Should I be doing this? What happens if I don't listen? Am I in control? What am I working towards? The game is uniquely frightening for the questions it, not only, makes you ask yourself but also forces you to ponder on.There's not a great way to demonstrate just how odd the game makes you feel without giving away the ending, but it is absolutely worth a try if you're happy to dedicate a few hours to find yourself falling deeper and deeper into a rabbit hole that doesn't want to let go of you. And that's one of the key elements of the game that can creep you out; you are told to stop playing the game, but the game doesn't want you to quit.""The most innovative shooter I've played in years.""",1
2015,"A beautifully constructed game filled to the absolute ♥♥♥♥ing brim with an immersive and relatable narrative. The game is gorgeous beyonds words, even at low graphics settings, the dialogue is so believable and cheery. Each change in the plot is just as engaging as the last and every odd noise of the forest will keep you on your toes. The game only takes about 3-5 hours to get through but is incredibly engaging and well structured for such a short period of time. Definitely worth a play if you get the chance, definitely one of the best narratively formed and engaging video games I've played in a while.Firewatch is beautiful.",1

2015,"9/10 I loved this game, it was amazing from start to finish and the added depth from the ""You look familiar"" thing if you reset a save, especially Flowey's taunting you about the fact that he knows if you killed Toriel and then reset evoked so many more emotions, so far I have only achieved the True Pacifist and the Neutral Ending, and therefore, it would be impossible for me to attempt a Genocide run especially when I don't need to, and the reason why? Toby did an excellent job with immersion, I truly feel that resetting everything and erasing everyone's memories would be the wrong thing to do, and since I know everything still, killing everyone would be like if you had a puppy until it died, then random magic made you go back to when you first met the puppy, but instead you were forced to kill it, you know all the fun things that you were going to do and still feel those connections, but even though they don't, you can't bring yourself to do it, because you'd rather go through all that time, even with the possibility of sad times, instead of stop it all from happening. Toby, thank you for making this, I almost cried many times, but my eyes wouldn't let me, I'll never forget the story you created through this game, 9/10 in the most realistic sense but 10/10 if that didn't mean that it was completely perfect.  If you want a game in the art style of Mother, fighting mechanics of Mother 3 and where your adoptive mother is a goat woman, this is the game for you. Or if you just wanna make a Tsundere Plane blush.",1

2015,"Guns of Icarus was a very enjoyable experience for my friends and I. The only problem I have with this game currently is the lag. Living in Australia, the Oceana and Asia servers are quite laggy. I've experienced randomly teleporting from place to place on the ship, as well as other ships suddenly being in a different location.",2
2015,"It's come to the point where people see the red flag of 'early access' and decide to skip, conditioned to do so by a large variety of games that show promise but are eventually abandoned by the developers to rot in a pool of graphical glitches and unfinished stories. Being one of those people, my initial reaction was to pirate this game, expecting something brief not worth my time. Instead, I found a thoroughly enjoyable experience that led me to actually buy the game and play through the levels I had so far completed again.I'll just say it now: I think it's worth buying Besiege for what it currently has to offer. a $7 price tag is insanely cheap for a game that I would expect to cost $15 or $20. While currently there are limited levels available, there really is an infite amount of time one can spend on them. If you simply rush through the game completing each level as fast as possible you'll likely be done in under 2 hours, dependant upon your proficiency.However, you'd be doing the game and yourself a great injustice. This game is not just about completing simple tasks. It's about completing them in the most wacky and roundabout ways you can imagine. You'll find yourself restarting levels to try new ideas, perhaps to beat your time or minimum amount of blocks used, or perhaps just to see if it'll work.Now that I've praised the game, here's what I don't like about it, keeping in mind these will probably all be solved in future updates.1. Lack of tutorialsWhile the game is relatively simple, there are no real tutorials to teach you what to do. If you're clever enough, you'll be able to figure out how to do basic functions by yourself (steering, flying, etc) and the game is all about building, testing, failing, building again. However, some basic tutorials to point players in the right direction could solve a lot of rage-quits.2. No multiplayerCome on developers, this is the obvious thing to do with the game. You add a multiplayer battle arena where you let people fight to the death with their machines, perhaps limiting their number of blocks or which blocks can be used. Maybe you could even add other multiplayer gamemodes, like races or castle sieges. To me this seems like the obvious direction to take the game in, because it'll be awesome and will encourage people to buy rather than pirate.3. The controlsThe controls for moving around the camera seem straightforward, yet somehow I always have trouble adjusting to them. I'm not sure why, everything works the way it should, but I always end up being far too zoomed out when trying to look at something from underneath.4. The lagThis is likely an inherent issue with the engine and not something easily fixable, but I thought it would be worth mentioning. I've got a pretty high end gaming pc, but on levels with a lot of enemies and a very large machine I do find the game to lag momentarily when I test my machine. Keep in mind I've only encountered this in specific scenarios and only for a few seconds before it settles.As you can see, these issues are all relatively minor and will likely be fixed in the future. Even if they weren't, I'd still recommend this game. Buy it.",2
2015,"So im sitting here on a lazy sunday night, and my friends are encouraging me to download this game. i know literally nothing about this game, except it is similar to castle crashers, apparently. i kinda can't be bothered downloading this, but peer pressure really sucks. so im gonna get this game, and i'll get back to you guys some time soon with the proper review of the game.",0

The dictionary is pretty good, but it's missing quite a lot (come on 5th Cell, ""fedora"" should be a word, I want to make all the characters look like euphoric neckbeards) but the challenges are very clever and some of the solutions are a blast.

2015,"Grand Theft Auto V is a fun game. A great game. I would recommend anyones this game. But Take-Two and to some extent Rockstar have been shutting down third party online servers, just so people play on theirs and buy in-game cash using real money. This is a tactic I do not support, and as a result I would recommend people buy this game. If you want to pirate go ahead, don't support this shady tactics",1
2015,"What is LIMBO about? I'ts... uh... hmm... It's what the discription says it's about, it's mearly about a boy who enters LIMBO, being uncertain of his sisters fate, and thats probably the only time you are going to get a description about what this game is about. Playing the game, all you know is that you are a boy going through this harsh and unforgiving forest, just moving right to your next obsticle. So simple, yet so perfercet for a game like this. You will get this simplicity going throughout the entire game, especially with your controls, with just up, down, left, right and Ctrl.bust dont fear for the game to be too simple, you will come across many gizmo's and obstacles that you need to use yor whits, some are dificult if your looking for a challenge, I admit I had to look up some gameplay for me to figure it out, (but that's just me, I kynda suck). The look of the game as beutiful as it is simple, just plain black and white, but it does not fail to amaze. This game is a truly unique experience, and I would highly reccomend it to any one.",1
2015,"Such an amazing game, has a compelling story, solid action, and the gameplay is overall fun! the game does lack in freedom though, it is quite linear, but it dosn't really bother you in forceful way. i would play the campagin again and again, even if it dosn't have choises you have to make to change your outcome at the end. 9/10",1

2015,"Great. Artifical Intelligence may destroy and enslave you. ENSLAAAVEE. It's a good game. You work with a dynasty. Your dynasty. In Europe and Africa. In High and Late Middle Ages. 1066 - 1453, 867 - 1453 with the DLC ""Old Gods"". You rule a country: From a small province to the greatest empire. You have your heirs, inherit laws and everything other, from taxes starting.   There are five levels of authority in the game; the four highest of which are playable at the start:   - Emperor, Kaiser, Basileus, Shahanshah, Khagan (highest ones).    - King, Shah, Despot, Sultan, Serene Doge, King Bishop, Khan, Prince Mayor. The title 'King' is equivalent to the title 'Archduke' if the holder bends the knee to an Emperor or person of equivalent title.    - Duke, Doux, Satrap, Emir, Doge, Grand Prince, High Chief, Prince Archbishop, Grand Mayor, Jarl, Petty King, Caliph.    - The second lowest rank is that of the Count – variations are Earl, Sheikh, Wâli, Marzban, Chief, Lord Mayor, Prince Bishop, Metropolitan (Orthodox).     -The lowest in-game rank of authority is that of the Baron – variations are Timariot, Shaman, Mayor, Bishop, Patrician – of which only Patrician is a playable rank if the player owns the The Republic DLC, as the government of only a single holding with no non-commoner courtiers to command would provide the player with very few or no opportunities for intrigue.    The basic provincial unit of the game is the ""county"". Each county contains a preset number of holdings, with the maximum being seven holdings in a single county, including the comital capital. The holdings can be of three types: castle, city or temple holding. A castle is ruled by a baron, a city is ruled by a Mayor, and a temple is ruled by a bishop (each one having their own cultural and religious variations, such as the Muslim Mosque). Generally, a county has a capital set on a barony, but some counties (most notably in Italy) have city or temples set as the capital (ex: Rome is a temple-capital county and Venice is a city-capital county). As the player incorporates a lay nobleman, it can only exert control adequate over counties with castles as capitals or he'll suffer the ""wrong holding type"" penalty in revenue – thus, city and temple holdings must be given to mayors and bishops. Exceptionally, Muslim rulers can control Mosques, which grant piety points. If the player owns The Republic DLC, the player can also take control of a coastal republic, like Venice, Genoa, The Hansa, Gotland or Cherson. In this case city holdings, instead of baronies, can be held without penalty.Realm LawsThere are two kind of laws in the game: the Tax and Levy laws – which determine the taxes your vassals (feudal, burgher and clergymen vassals) must pay, and also the number of levies they must provide – and the Succession Laws – which can be of two types: gender and inheritance laws. Succession laws are of fundamental gameplay importance, as the game over condition is the player's inability of establishing a dynastic heir. As a rule, succession is patrilineal, which means marriage offsprings will always be from the father's dynasty, but there is the option of matrilineal marriages for female characters, which means the offspring will be from the mother's lineage.   Gender Laws are the following: Agnatic – Only males inheirt Agnatic-Cognatic – Females can inherit, but only if there are no eligible male heirs. Absolute Cognatic – Women inheirt on the same grounds as men do. (this type of succession is only available to Basque culture characters and the rulers with Cathar religion)However, although Paradox added Enatic (males are entirely excluded from succession) and Enatic-Cognatic (females have preference) succession, these are only accessible through modifications to the base game.   Inheritance Laws are: Gavelkind – The most common law, in which the inheritance is divided among all eligible children, the oldest inheriting the primary title. This succession type allows for a 30% larger demesne, the disadvantage is that it fractures the demesne upon succession. Feudal Elective – The heir elected by vassals holding elector titles inherits all titles. This type gives an opinion boost to vassals, but it might have an heir not from the players dynasty—therefore ending the game. Seniority – the oldest dynasty member inherits all titles. The disadvantage is that it usually results in elder characters inheriting, potentially creating a quick succession of short-lived rulerships. Primogeniture – the firstborn child inherits all titles, in depth-first search descent. Arguably the most advantageous inheritance type, but it incurs in a slight prestige penalty for landless progeny. Agnatic Open/Turkish Succession – available to every Muslim character (and also the only type of succession available) – the son that holds most titles inherits all his father's titles. Patrician Elective (With The Republic DLC) – the only succession type for Merchant Republics – the heir is decided upon by a calculation of age, prestige, and a unique campaign fund feature from the 5 patrician families. Only males can inherit. Investiture - only succesion law for bishoprics where the successor can be appointent by the ruler if under Free Investiture or by the Pope if under Papal Investiture. If there is no appointed heir then the game will chose character from the court of the bishop or create a new character if there is no suitable characters in the bishops court. Elective Open – the only succession type for Republics (and also some types of holdings under the player level) – the game will chose a character from the republic rulers court or create a new character if there is no suitable characters in the mayors court. Tanistry – open to Celtic Culture group which, like the Elective system allows vassals to choose the heir but restricts the choice to members of the current holders dynasty. Ultimogeniture – the default succession type for Ilkhanate, the Golden Horde and the barony of Altenburg, in which the youngest child of the ruler inherits all the rulers titles upon their death. Appointment - Used by Holy Orders feudal vassals called Commanders. All feudal titles are granted by the Grandmaster and revert back to him after the holder dies. Papal Succession - Pope's succesion law where elected Cardinal's chose the next Pope among themselves. Only used by the Pope if the player owns the Sons of Abraham DLC. King and Emperor-level characters also have a special set of available laws, the ""Crown Authority Laws"", which simulate the power exerted by the monarch over his vassals. For example, with ""autonomous vassals law"", the monarch cannot revoke vassal's titles, and they only provide levies to their liege if they hold him or her in high regard. In ""absolute crown authority law"", the vassals are entirely forbidden of waging war against each other and foreign enemies and must provide a sizable amount of levies.That's a really really good game for about 1894172381274109487128409 hours of gameplay.",1

Skyrim is comparably smaller to the previous maps but much more interesting, with different landscapes such as frosty mountains, plains, hot springs and hill's skyrim has the most interesting landscape thus far. The gameplay is immersive and different with multiple ways to play the game, and all skills can be maxed, if you get bored of being a warrior with a mace and a shield you can start playing with magic at any time or pick up a knife and sneak around slitting throats and cutting purses. The story has a great feeling of importance and grandness to it keeping you absorbed in the myriad of different stories to be told abouts skyrim, aided by the great design and pieces of literature scattered around the world giving more detail to the lore. 9/10 excellent game.",2

2014,"This game is based on one of the greatest non-serious movies I have ever seen and is also one of the greatest games I have ever played. Gameplay breaks down into two buttons; left mouse (or arrow) and right mouse (or arrow), even though it is so simplistic, the execution is perfect. All you are doing is killing Nazi's with your fists but it gets more complex as you play for example, the most common enemy is a Nazi wearing a gas mask, they die in one hit so they are easy to kill. Next up is a Nazi with blonde hair, they take two hits instead of one. After that you have Nazi women - and once they are in the mix, ♥♥♥♥ goes down - they take three hits to kill but, once you hit them they quickly teleport behind you meaning if you hit them from the right, they end up on your left ready to attack so, you must react quickly to hit them again by switching sides but, like I said before, they take three hits so, they will end up behind you again. After the women comes the Nazi Robots. They take four hits but, if you are not quick to destroy them, they will jump back and gang up with other enemies. There is no other strategy against them except to kill them as quickly as possible. The last enemy I have encountered is a Red Ninja and he is special because he is a robot and a woman combined meaning when you hit him, he will teleport behind you and on the second hit, he will jump back and gang up with other enemies.  The Red Ninja takes five hits and he kills me everytime I face him. In order to make this game more challenging, the developers added a health system for you, you have three hit points and no way to regenerate them (at least not from what I have seen). The entire point of this game is to get the highest score possible and it is a challenge to even get onto the leaderboard. If you like beat em ups with simple controls and want a challenge, buy this game now.",0

No : Yes (programmers will understand this); - Documentation isn't as in-depth as some of the meatier engines out there- People make stuff for this game in Workshop- Pre-made events make it easier, but what if you wanted to make a game in a different engine?TL;DRGood for top-down RPGs, not so much for other games - but not impossible",2
2015,"It works fine.That is until you find an ammo crate full of hats, a nearby truck full of hats, a locker with a gun you can't pick up, 5 hackers gunning you down from across the map, and a rifle with no bullets.On the up-side, uninstalling it works perfectly.",2
2015,"**This is subject to change as updates come through**Forsaken Fortress Strategy; where do I start?It's still in EA, so I'll go easy on it, but for the kind of genre it's going into, I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down. Sorry Photon Arena, but that's how it is. Here's why:Pros:- Interesting survivor mechanics- Solid design and most things have a logical flow to them- Diverse enough game modes (unlike most other games of this type)Cons:- No tutorial game mode (or tooltips in-game). Sorry community guide writers (you guys are awesome), but a game like this should have one by default- Help section doesn't actually help much; the descriptions are quite bare; and there's missing content- Building functionality essentials are 'missing'; by that I mean, they aren't in the help section- Neutral NPCs appear as enemies on the map- Very repetitive events- I can hear the zombies, but I can't see them...in the day time**If you're one of 'those' people (and I can understand why)**- Made in Unity 3D <--- Not a con in my books (even though I am a UE person)I'm not asking for someone to hold my hand here, but there is a difference between hand-holding, and giving players a handy-dandy, well-written reference.",2
2015,"Here's a video I did on it:https://youtu.be/8713Tjh4KfU?list=PLYoRcETHLyMUs5Xdpu5jusjWyykQhm7D_I like it; overall gameplay elements like luck and ability cards add to the standard turn-based strategy elements of the game. The 'essential character' makes every situation a do-or-die situation since I just started again with the 'Ironman' modifier on.Story-wise it's repetitive, although most games like this (X-Com for example) suffer from repitition- then again, what game doesn't? To break that up, you've got prospecting, mini-stories, a whole range of things going - but that can be a little distracting.",2
2015,"This game is simply amazing. This sandbox game has attempted to go over an obstacle that most sandbox games suffer from, the feeling that you have nothing left to do. And let me just say, the developers have done this beautifully, instead leaving you thinking of what to do next. The best thing about this game is that the developers are willing to listen to suggestions from the community, something as a game developer you need to take advantage of.  If you enjoy games like Minecraft and Terraria, you NEED to check out this game.",1

2005,"I died so much and Killed so many demons. But it was ♥♥♥♥ing worth it. Keep in mind this aint no ♥♥♥♥ of duty no regen health here, no sprint you must move with haste and kill to survive. If this is your first doom game you are going to have one HELL of a time and if you are a returning veteran you will notice the parallels between Brutal Doom and DOOM but I can assure you that you are going to really enjoy yourself but keep in mind playing on ultra-violence or above is the real way to have the propper DOOM experience and I would recommend this dificulty even on a first playthrough (This however can be changed at any time to suit your needs). The only main problem is this game suffers from Consoleitis i.e no modding support which is a huge bummer as every Doom before this one had modding tools and support bundled with the game all that is offered here is ""snap map"" which has been designed for ease of use with you guessed it consoles. Not to mention of course a season pass as well which only offers Multiplayer content.Overall I rate this game 8.5/10",1

2015,FTL is an amazing game which perfectly balances difficulty with enjoyability. There are many things to explore and it never gets old. Weapons and the different types of ships are always fun to try out as each needs a different strategy from the next. Many times you find yourself with the difficult decision of whether to investigate an empty ship or run away. Customisation is always fun especially when naming your ship and crew. I would highly recommend this game. One of the best indie games i've played.,1

2015,"Warframe. A third-person sci-fi shooter with RPG elements, that at a glance would resemble Mass Effect. Pros:+ Great variety of guns and 'classes'  + Fast-paced combat+ Decent modification options+ Colourful graphics+ Nice clan system (which I have yet to experience since I don't have any friends)+ Free to play. All microtransactions (save the cosmetics) can be unlocked sooner or later. If there is anything enticing about the game, it's the 'classes' which are referred to as warframes. Different warframes have different stats and skillsets that caters for specific types of gameplay. The guns themselves, though there are not s*** loads of them, are complemented by a weapons system that allows for a great deal of experimentation and theory-crafting, especially when combined with an impressive number of modifications. The Dojo or clan system allows even more access to guns and mods. The gameplay itself is extremely simple; shoot enemies when you see them (aiming for the head if you're a CS veteran), and take cover when you're a bit low, using your primary, secondary, melee or ability anywhere in between. Movement and gun physics are refined and not a great deal of skill is required to scrap some AI metal.Does the game come with microtransactions? Yes. Is it pay-to-win? No. *Thank goodness?* Save for cosmetics, any game altering gun, class or modification can be unlocked at some stage of the game. You won't need to spend a penny, but lots and lots of time. Which leads to:Cons:- Grinding for mods / weapons / 'classes'- Missions feel repetititve after a while- Lack of story / weak contextThe cons though are more than enough to put someone off. We've seen it many times before in F2P and many people are looking for a game that breaks through this cliché. But to compensate for the fact that any mini purchasable item can be unlocked, players are required to grind ( a bit hard ) to unlock the parts they desire. In terms of missions, I could probably list all the game types using my fingers (*edited there are 14 mission types, some with alternate modes etc.) and this does become repetitive after you've played the game for a while. The game lacks a storyline; and whatever attempt is made to seem like there can be totally ignored, and the lore itself is lacklustre. But how is Warframe then still fun to play? One word. FRIENDS. We may not have any, but it is MORE THAN RECOMMENDED to have a friend or more playing this game with you. It exponentially enhances the experience both in terms of gameplay and content. There's a reason why this game is tagged under co-op. ",1
2015,Portal is a fun game at points but the puzzles become to easy but the challenge levels are fun and i think portal isn't really worth the $10.00 but it still is a fun game and the story leaves you to wonder in the end 7/10,1

2015,"This game is exhilerating. Before life is strange i had never really liked any story games, just stuck with cs:go and Team fortress 2. But this game is different. You really get wrapped up in the story, you start to act like and believe that you're max. I've only played episode 1 so far and i'm already addicted. You may think to yourself ""but i hate games that require's puzzles and brain power!"". well, that doesn't matter. I am stinking terrible at puzzle games and i still found it enjoyable. So in conclusion, do I think you should get this game? Yes, For sure. Am i saying that you'll love it no matter what? No, i'm just saying from the pov of someone that typically only like FPS's, This game was a pleasant surprise.Peace out, and if you get the game, have a good time playing it, i hope it was worth your money :) ;).",1

There is humor at times that lighten the mood amongst most of the sad parts, but even then, it doesn't really take you away from the story. Heck I can even relate to it a bit, losing people...wanting to be able to fufill a promise...even wanting to go back and correct mistakes, but in the end it shows that even if things change, some things will always remain the same...even if it doesn't look like it now.",1

2014,"When I picked up this game on promotion , I didnt know what to expect , I have heard review of it , but let me tell you .This video game actually made me concerned for the characters. I didnt want to see how many ways laura could die , I wanted to save her friends so badly, so much so that I had to remind myself that time wont affect the outcome of the game and I could go off venturing into the tombs and raiding it.Its an adventure game , and in that sense if accomplishes exactly that. I felt empty after the game was over. It took me on a heck of an unforgettable adventure , despite it being ""generic"" or not . I felt attached and but sad that i completed it only over 4.5 hours with 75% completion and all tombs raided.What I really hope for the sequel is that laura isint an invincible badass , just a badass. Even though she does superhuman things ingame , I really she will be human and she will continue caring for others.",1

2015,As you move through the frost bitten remains of the trench stuck in a pit of dead allies and enemies you no not if this brings victory or death. You are being pounded by a machine gun as you use a small wall to cover you from the rain of bullets. Because your position has slowly become overrun the commander calls artillery on you. The horns of death play through the end as you hear the grim reaper raise his scythe. You are now given the choice of your death you can choose to stand up and fight before the machine gun blast you to pieces or sit their hoping that by some small chance you might survive the artillery strike either way your chances of surviving the next 5 minutes are small. You watch the tank move forward as the first three ranging shots come in for artillery. You stand up deciding to die fighting. Stepping up from your cover you lock eyes with a German soldier you stare at each other for a second hesitating the shot. The first salvo begins. More shots land in your vicinity. You both raise your rifle. You move to fire. The moments is broken by an artillery shell. You stare at the german seeing his soul. The ground rips around you. You see your hands flying off. the german turns into mist. Everything goes black.This game is amazing an excellent example of a realistic shooter. You don't take a break because you are bored. You take a break because you're emotionally exhausted.,1
2015,So this my old review This game is clearly not at a ready standard. As someone who likes to play Red Orchestra 2 this game was a disappointment it does have postives and I feel that it will become worth my money once they add more stuff but at its current state don't buy it. If you are looking for an intense realistic shooter do not get this get Red Orchestra 2.Developer response:M2H_Mike  [developer] Posted: 31 Oct @ 9:50pmLots has changed since your review. I would appreciate it if you'd check out the game again and let me know if we're going the right direction :)But I feel its not time to make another after playing a bit more. Even though I have not played an awful lot of time there is a clear improvement beofre I would given it a 3/10 but now i would say 6/10 I can happily say in the future this game will 8/10 for me game still feels a bit clunky but looks beautiful and does feel much better to play I will wait a couple more updates to play but it is starting to be worth cost. Keep up the good work.,1

2015,"Cool little game worth the buy. But there is some improvement I would like to see for example larger amount of people on a single server 16 & 10 is good for a lot of the maps but something 32 or 64 would be awesome. of coure a alrger player base would be needed but it would be cool to see it would need some larger maps though which means user created maps would be useful. If more players on a server were added I would like to see classes aswell instead of the guy with infinte guns that can materialise out of thin air. Alot of this would be solved once this game gets more popular. But apart from this, awesome game looks amazing and plays well.",1
2015,"Not really a fan of FPS, but do enjoy this one! There's a large range of weapons to use, enemy AI is decent (I've only been playing on average difficulty), movement is floaty and fun, and the choice of maps (especially) and game modes is awesome. Haven't played online multiplayer yet, but sure that it'd be pretty good too. Would definitely recommend this game - for the casual or hardcore FPS player.",1
2015,"The best thing about this game is it's soundtrack.Oh yeah, and the cool masks you get to wear when you're blowing someone's brains out!Love this game...",1
2015,"Have always had my eye on this game; finally purchased it during the Steam Christmas sale.Was so glad I did.The game's campaign mode, although short, has a great little story and teaches the player how to properly manage their own pison. You play through five different chapters, all complete with their own unique characters and challenges. However, the best part comes when you get to manage your own prison - freeplay mode. There are many options to customise your game (eg. sandbox, presence of gangs, spawning of random buildings) to make it all the more fun, while the plethora of rooms, objects, characters and prison management will keep you entertained for hours. I'll guess you'll just have to buy it to see how good it is!",1
2015,"Have been spying this game for a while and I'm glad I finally bought it.For an early access game, or any game for that matter, the visuals are vibrant, wildlife interesting and crafting system indepth, but not too ""grindy"". The fact of the game offering several modes - survival (most realistic), freedom (best for exploring) and creative (best for building) - also makes it playable at a range of different difficulties, thus appealing to a wider audience - for those hardcore to more casual gamers. With the added bonus of console commands, the player can also spawn an infinite number of resources, blueprints and equipment which adds to the game's accessibility - I first used console commands to get a ""feel"" for the game and have opted to start over without for a real survival experience. Additionally, the developers seem to be adding new updates frequently so you can be sure you are investing into a worthwhile game which will be amazing when completed!- Valiance",1
2015,"Game is good, but it isn't great. Have only played single-player at the moment which I've found to be pretty easy so far. Items and clothing are easy to acquire, there's lots of them... somehow you're always finding something better to use in game which kind of makes the stuff you find feel less valuble. Graphics and animation are pretty basic, although the blood splatter's impressive (you'll even find it on the ceiling). The ability to drive vehicles is pretty cool too. While single-player does feel kind of montonous and pointless, hopefully multiplayer will be better and serve more of a purpose. Despite this, I would suggest giving this game a try - just don't expect too much.",1
2015,"Not much to the game; however, the retro influence of its music and levels makes it a winner! Something easy just to play, enjoy and not think too much about. Would recommend.",1
2015,Its really good but they should add steam workshop for easier Mod downloading. PEACE,1
2015,"This game has a great atmoshpere to it, the graphics are amazing and it's crafting system is very simple but some materials are scarce so you must go deeper to find them. overall i rate the game 7/10 (it's still in early access so i can't give a full rating)",1
2015,The games awesome with all the mods and everything but i wish it would have the steam workshop and easier server creating like in space Engineers or something but overall i would rate it somthing like a 8/10,1

2015,"This game is like a satisfying mix of World of Warcraft and top-down Legend of Zelda games. The artstyle is really nice, and there's a lot of depth to this seemingly simple and childish game. There are so many different ways to build your character, and there's an armour, weapon or pet that accomodates your desires for any playstyle, be it a tanky melee fighter, a powerful ranged DPS or an AoE support. is rly good",2

2015,"Ragnarok Online is one of the few MMORPG i have ever played. Back then Ragnarok Online was entirely pay to play so in order to play, private servers were made. Until gravity made it free-to-play which made people play the original servers rather than private servers.So, Ragnarok Online is a animated 3D fantasy MMORPG. Players can move around and explore the world through a simple yet polish point and click controls. Ragnarok Online has an interesting system where players have two levels, a base level and a job level, How you raise those levels is by gaining experience either by clearing quests or killing monsters, but the job level tends to level up slower. Each base level earns you status points that can be allocated into different attribute and each job level earns you job points which you can allocate into skills which the player can use.What makes Ragnarok Online feel like a complete game is the large selection of job advancements.",1

I mean, who wouldn't want to play a game about a ninja trying to destroy the evil red bars of doom when he has a awesome grapling hook and can take down the red bars with a single kick?But unfortunatly he has been cursed by the magic evil villian (who sent the army of red bars of doom) and is now a dot but he is still 100% baddass. Now as a dot you must destroy all the red bars to free your self from this horrible curse. but if you become the slightest bit angry then you will destroy all hopes of you ever freeing yourself. luckily he is weraing headphones of calming music so you can kick ♥♥♥ and chew bubbule gum (until your all out of gum) carmly. :)good luck. No realy you will need it considering every time you play the evil magic villain summons more red bars every day.

We soon find a bus and drive around chernarus but then we hear someone saying FRIENDLY? we found him in a hospital we gave him water food bandages then he headed off, we then found a a factory we head in it.

2015,"I reccomend this to everyone who loves zombie survival games. This game has so many friendly people more than DayZ so i had alot of great encounters with people. Crossed a road a guy asked me if i wanted to come with him i didnt know how to chat so he shot me but i wasnt mad because he probably thought i was getting a gun. HOLY CRAP A SPIDER!! oh wait just some dust nevermind that back to the game. The game is great the zombie spawn rate isnt too high but no too low, It runs smoothly (depending your internet and computer) ive got a laptop that WASNT made for gaming and it runs smoothly but i do have to turn the graphics low for its best gameplay. I hope you want to get this game because it deserves it. BATTLE ROYALE// battle royale is of course based off battle royale and its good it puts a twist on BR with zombies and not as many guns :) havent played a round of it yet but i'm sure me and you will like it alot. Remember DayZ mod? this is like it except more crafting less zombies less guns but more possibilities of wich some you can take >:)Hero/GoodGuy: This role you will help others but will take action if other player is not friendly, You will give others spare food low graded weapons (because they will possibly turn on you if too op) water and maybe even some crafting supplies.Bandit/BadGuy: You kill any player that sets foot in your sight, You either work in a Bandit group or alone you live off others supplies and only scavange for supplies that can kill! You will never help anyone in need you will torture your victim in any way possible and you may even kill them you may just let them bleed out like a torture mechanism. Neutral/Citizen: You scavange for supplies and try to avoid people in fear of them being a Bandit. You dont kill anyone unless self defence, if you do encounter someone and they see you, you try to talk but you are catious of that little chance of them killing you. You will always be that one guy who has hardly any loot. But Once someone gets good loot they have the choice.Hero?

2015,Counter-Strike - The classic game that never gets old. The Multiplayer experience is great for casuals or competitive players alike.

2015,"Amazing Competitive game with a steep learning curve when you first start playing the game. However, once you get the basics of the game, you will find Natural Selection 2 to be a very fun game with lots of teamwork and strategy involved while you battle together with your teammates to fight for dominance around the map and eventually to win the game. Coordination between teammates and getting more res is key to this game. Great multiplayer experience that will be fun for years to come. Highly recommended.",1

2014,just like half life 1 but better lighting you can increase field of view have better options to make the game look better the hd pack for hl1 source I don't know how to make the SMG work right the reload sound does not work in hd mode overall it is a enchanced version of the same game also you will want this for HL1 scientist posing in garry's mod not the orginal I would give this game a 11/10 for the better lighting the water doesn't fit in the game without hl2 graphics mods you can make the water reflect everything but I like the water the way it is in this game enchanced water like,2
2014,this game has a good story where you are a scientist his name is GORDEN FREEMAN doing an experiment when you get to the lab thats all I can say don't want to spoil if the experiment teleports you to xen and fight your way out or have to get out of black mesa and go to xen you have to find out GORDEN YOUR LATE!,2

2015,"I have played all the other gemcraft games, and I can assure you that this still holds true to the series excellence. There is still insane amounts of content, some for beginners and more for the more dedicated players. Endurance mode still exists, and plenty of other modifiers to the game to make it more difficult for more rewards, and of course there is still a wide variety of gems with different powers to choose from. There are also easy keyboard shortcuts to make upgrading, bombing and combining easier.This is the absolute best tower defence series available.",1

I suggest playing with other people to have maximum quality and see how much creativeness your mind can withhold.If you are really creative you can create your own gamemode or even your own map, it depends on your hearts desire on what you want to do in this game! Create battles, create buildings or plain sillyness. As long as your having fun on the game.BTW the first thing i saw on a sandbox server was player models doing a pose. so yea, its a great game!",1

2015,"This game is great! Even with the remaster/reboot/sequel? (I haven't played rebirth as of this recommendation) I still find myself coming back to this game time and time again due to its replayability with its randomly generated levels/rooms that make every game different and are similar to the first Legend of Zelda's dugeons, where you have to beat every enemy in the room to continue forward. You also collect items on the way either found in rooms with a gold crown on the door, the store, random encounters with certain enemies, secret rooms and even more...also all the items are either  similar or different to each other so it can be quite easy to get an awesome combo to beat your enemies...or a bad combo :beatmeat: you can also get usable items like cards, bombs or books that can either shield you, increase your attack or even make you invincible. Overall, I love this game,I love its soundtrack, I love its art style, I love its simply story and I love its gamplay :)",1

2015,"This is actually a really great game.But sadly there are so many clever cheaters here.There are some programe you can purchase in order to cheat undetected on CS along with other games.If somehow Valve can develop a cheaters free game experience.I must say, this will be a must buy game.Before that, it is kind of annoying.And dun tell me I am too bad for CS. I am experience enough to recognize a cheat or skill.",1
2015,"this is a brilliant game, when more updates come out and people get to do more in the game it will be alot better",2
2015,"i'll start by saying that iv'e played many a puzzle game and am a self-titled veteran of the point and click genre. This game is an excellent example of the two, with a very nicely executed yet simple formula present in its levels; screw around with enviroment, find items via the affore mentioned screw around with the enviroment, combine items/ screw around with items, play short often skipable mini-game, rinse and repeate (the interface can feel a tad clunky). but the graphics do let it down, i felt like i was playing a game with an ENB preset made by a blind, semi-brain dead, jelly fish. but worse than the grapghics was the voice acting, it felt like somebody had kidnapped a random guy off the street, handed him a script, then pointed a loaded shotgun at his balls. but aside from its mostly ignorable flaws, it is a very good game worth devoting a few minutes and a few dollars",1

2014,"A great little game. Took 3 hours to beat on normal, and theres still a new game+, duel mode, and arcade mode. The shooting is fluid, with plenty of action. The narration is witty as well, with the scenery changing as the narrator remembers part of the story. There is also 3 different skill paths to take, either shotgun, rifle, or duel pistols. All in all, a great game.",1

2014,"I've been playing Unturned for a short period of time, but I have to say that it is looking very promising. As i've only played the free version of the game, i'm yet to see the features that are available when playing the premium version. When you first open the game, you're given the opportunity to create a character. There are a variety of customisation options available, however some of which are only unlocked with the premium version of the game. Once passed the character customisation stage, which can be edited later anyway, you can choose between a singleplayer, multiplayer and tutorial option. Being a man that likes to learn for himself, I reframed from playing the tutorial, but for the sake of reviewing Unturned, I did. The tutorial gives you a basic rundown of the controls; movement, combat and driving, simple but helpful. Then I decided to jump straight onto singleplayer. Unturned gives you two options of maps to play on; PEI, which is your basic 'post-apocalyptic' map with buildings and towns, and Arena; a difficult map, which places you in an arena like area with nothing but the forest around you. I decided to play on the PEI map first. Once spawned, i realised that you start off with nothing, and I LITERALLY mean nothing, you dont even spawn with clothes on. The spawning in Unturned is random, so I was spawned near a walled off area which i later found was a military base. I fought my way through the base and gathered a few supplies including a backpack, handgun and suppresor, and a map of the whole of PEI. While in this menu, I discovered a skills menu, which can be upgraded by earning eperience though killing zombies, and a crafting menu, which didnt make sense to me so I decided to leave it be. Judging from the map, it seemed that PEI was a large scale map, that had many places to visit, so I decided to visit the local town. Once i arrived, I was greeted by a large horde of zombies. I managed to pick off 5 of them with my handgun, but i ran out of ammo and had to run for about 5 minutes before running upstairs into a house and dying because I got stuck in the tub. This is the point where I decided I was bad at video games and also decided to play on the other ma, Arena. Once loaded, it spawned me into an arena like area. The areanwas surrounded by water ans there were tall rocks around me, vaguely resembling Stone Henge, and some supplies, however, due to the small inventory space, I could only carry a small knife and three seed which i planted soon after. I decided to venture out into the woods and I quickly got lost. My hunger and thirst bars needed tending to, so i decided to hunt some animals, and quickly realised that the pigs I was chasing were very fast, or that my player spent too much time writing a pointless review of a game that nobody will ever read, so he gained a substancial amount of weight and decided not to go outside anymore. I soon realised that the only way to satisfy these meters was to travel back to the spawn and harvest the seeds i planted earlier, but I unsucessfully did so and died trying to find which way I came from. Then I decided to try out the multiplayer secion of the game, but was unable to do so because I have no friends. Unturned is a great game, however, I do feel that playing with friends would give you a much different and better experience in contrast to playing by yourself. Unturned feels like a very basic version of DayZ, or games similar to this, and this is not a bad thing. Unturned gives you a similar experience to these games, but it expresses itself in a much different way, this is mainly bue to the blocky artstyle of the game, which much resembles games like Roblox and Minecraft. Unturned is the type of game that you could let your 7 year old brother play, without getting into trouble by your mum for letting him play a violent video game, but can still be played by the older demographic just the same. To summarise this review, I reccomed this game to anyone, however, get some friends, whip up a server and play together, and you'll have a much better experience. Do I see potential in this game? Yes I do, so long as the developers continue to work hard and listen to the community and take their ideas on boards as well as their own. Give Unturned a try, you wont be let down.",2
2014,"GReat look, great mechanics, all in all, great game, but to really experience it to is full potential, play competitive. Causal is just full of hackers and is really imbalanced if you just started playing, you'll get killed every 5 seconds.",2
2014,"This may be the greatest game in existence.Despite its many bugs and glitches it is a great game. Hundreds of hours of fun. Even with the amount of time I've put into this game I've barely scratched the surface. And most of that has come solely from the level editor.The editor is really fun to play around with, helicopter raids, tank missions, HALO jumps, patrols, ambushes, you name it, you can more than likely do it.The only real problem you might encounter with this game is its difficulty. There is a pretty steep learning curve to get used to it. Theres no second lives, theres no attack dog bonuses. It is probably as close as you'll ever get to war.I wouldn't recommend this to any looking for a quick, CoD style deathmatch. ArmA II's combat takes patience, practice and more patience. A definate must-buy for anyone looking for some large scale warfare, tactical combat or military simulation games.",2
2014,My dream of becoming Bear Grylls has finally come true.,2
2014,"This game....how do I put it...Its like what you would expect a 3D browser game made on Adboe Shockwave to be like.There's nothing here....its not worth it, even if it was free.",2
2014,"First I'll list my problems with this game:- Theres no ingame tutorial. I didn't know what to do with myself when I first played this. It should be explaining as you go what to do and how to do it. Instead it gives you the option to pause the game and watch some 20 minute videos on the Steam forums. That is so stupid. Just explain to me what to do when I'm playing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing.- There is really nothing to do. You can build massive ships and some pretty cool stuff but what after that? Just fly around aimlessly. - The controls are so bad it isnt funny. You press T to interact with objects, to press buttons, get in ships etc, why?T is all the over the other side of the keyboard why would they make one of the most used actions in the game in such an awkward spot. There is 2 jump buttons for some reason, space and F. Why did F have to be a jump button? Why not get rid of that stupid T and replace it with F, and just leave space to jump?And guess what, you can't change the controls.- When flying ships, up is up and down is down. This takes a while to get used to, especially when you've played alot of other flight simulators, where up is down and down is up. To make it even worse, theres no invert look option solely for ships. You can either have it on or off, meaning looking will be inverted when you're on foot to.- Everything is so slippery. You have a jetpack, and its so awkward to manouver yourself. Moving forward makes you tip to the side and flip upside down, while the camera gets stuck and you cant see what youre doing!- The ships arent very clear on how to operate them / interact with them. You see a massive yellow circle sort of thing attached to the bottom of it, so it only makes sense to try and enter the ship that way. No, you have to go over to the dull grey cockpit with no obvious markings to show you enter there.And that concludes my review. Its boring, no tutorial and the most pathetic controls I've ever seen.",2
2014,"The game is just....bah.One of my major problems with this game is the fact that you walk sooooo slowly. They give you big forest but expect you to take 6 hours to get around. The headbob gives me a headache, and there is no option to reduce it or turn it off. What were they thinking.Who shakes that much when you are walking so slowly anyway?The game is pretty scary, but Slenderman doesn't really jump out at you much, he sort of just watches you. Well, that is only in the first couple of episodes, before I had to take a break and rest my eyes.Just, don't buy this game.",2

2014,"Am I seriously missing something here?I'm not having a whole ton of fun with game. Tons of bugs and glitches everywhere, really bad performance issues. There is no tutorial or anything to help you, well you wont really need any help because all your gonna be doing through the whole game is PICKING UP KEYS AND UNLOCKING DOORS!!!!! Where is the variety guys? C'mon....The maps are decent but not too special, and how come being a monster just really sucks!?! You would think that you would feel pretty cool being a monster but in this GAME you feel so cheap and pathetic. I was hoping you could do many cool things as a monster like trigger things, make people hallucinate and like fly around and drop in right behind a dude and scare the living daylights out of him. BUT NO! You can't do that, well atleast from my playthroughs I couldn't. As a monster in this game, you run around the area searching for people for hours and hours and hitting them then in one hit, they're dead. Very misleading... I wasn't frightened one bit in this game, the only thing I could say that scared me much was the freaking music that plays when a person is running away from you while your the monster, it just suddenly pops in, scaring the bajeezus outta you. But one poor decision that I hate in this game is that when your the lurker, you can't see anybody until you manifest. I find it very stupid but some people might disagree with me. Only my opinionAll I can say left about this game is that the premise of it sounds incredible but the dev's executed it poorly. I know it's in a earlier stage of development but still feels like a very VERY earlier version of the game that the dev's should only have. PLEASE DEVELOPERS LISTEN OUT!!! Sorry for being harsh but please change some of these decisions that you've made, it would definitely change my thoughts about this a lot. Wait people, till these get fixed, I just can't recommend just yet.",1

It's quite fun when you're playing with friends, but that's about it.

2014,"It was about half a year ago that I first played this game, and at the time it didn't really grab my attention all that much. I would have to say that the first part of the first episode (the only one I had played at that point), is not exactly representative of the game as a whole; it gets a whole lot better. Recently I acquired a PC that could actually play this game (my first foray into the game being on an xbox 360). and I picked up the game for 75% off during a Steam Sale. And I have to say, it is one of the better games I have ever bought.Playing through this game is an incredible experience. It continues to be as such on consecutive playthroughs, but nothing can compare to that first time. The choices you have to make have an incredible impact, and can drastically change how large portions of the game play out.In the end, if you're a fan of the Walking Dead TV show, but even more so if you are a fan of the comic books, then you should definitely pick this up. It is an experience that will change you forever, and I could not more highly recommend it.",1
2014,"Basically, if you enjoyed Far Cry 3, then you should like this game. If you like the Terminator, Aliens, Robocop... or anything else '80s', then you will love this game.

I already i bought the game I don't want to pay for hats>You can buy in game weapons with real money. Unfair advantage>DLC is just a reskinned version of the orginal gameSo this game is not worth the full price. Only buy it if it is on sale.,1
2014,It's very fun but it takes a little bit to get into it and understand how to play properly.,1
2014,This has potential to be a good game. At the moment it is boring and repeatitive after a few hours of gameplay. Also the fact that there are 3 different classes all with different gameplay make for a long grind to get better weapons. Good use of vechiles though,1

2014,"The Battlefield series has got to be one of the most detailed FPS i have ever played and battlefield: Bad company 2 is no different! The game has some amazing physics letting you use your surroundings as a lethal weapon. Also, the graphics on this game are crystal clear showing you in HD how war effects your surroundings. There are also a wide range if different characters from serious to being funny, to stupid to being very clever! And we cant forget about the guns and vehicles. The guns are highley detailed and fit perfevtly into the game adding more realism to the game. And the vehicles have had alot of attention on them too seeing that they look amazing too! The story is perfect for any new beginers to the series and the multiplayer is just pure beautiful! If you are wondering wether to buy this game you should definetly but this one in the cart and check it out because i can guarantee endless fun with this game! Wether fighting the terrorists off in story or capturing towns in multiplayer you will have something to do in this game! 5/5 from me! Thanks for reading",1
2014,If you like your history and your planes then this game is the perfect game for you. With friends this game can be fun but also serious. The only problem is probly the controll system because of the mass amount of buttons to press. But apart from that i recommend you download this game considering its free!,1
2014,"In the present day 4 people set out to steal from banks, Run from the F.B.I, transport coke, fight off the swat and much more. You follow 4 people in PAYDAY 2 called Dallas (The thinker), Chains (The muscle), Wolf (The technician) and Hoxton (The ghost). As the player we get to select which character we wish to play as but it doesnt stop there. You can pick the skills you want your character to learn, The mask he wears, The guns he uses and the way he enters. Payday 2 Is brilliant with its coustomization of masks and guns making your character 1 of a kind and the guns can effect the results of the robery, Hold off or escape. The game missions will always change by either changung the postions of the vaults to adding more guards to adding more cameras and other possiblities. It would be near impossible to explain all of the changes this game can do with just a click of the restart mission button. To be honest at first i thought this may be like Payday:The heist so i was kind of put off but i watched some videos and read about it and now playing it it feels like the creators have listend to the fans and have improved the game. From missions to your safe house everything feels like it never gets old. Lastly, one feature that caught my eye is the card choice. If any of you reading this have played with me you will know that i love this bit. It allows you to get items which cant be obtained through normal assestes e.g kill 100 SWAT, Rob 50 banks ect. You get given 3 cards and you have to choose one  and the results vary. From new gun attachments to new masks this method never gets old. And the best bit is it usually happens when you complete a heist so you get money and other things yay. Oh and money is more usefull, You can now buy alot of equipment now so insted of just getting it for looking purposes you can spend it on paint for your masks or weapon mods. From characters to gameplay the game never lacks to impress me. Only problem i had was a bit of lag but if you do have that there is an option to turn the graphics down so it runs nicer and smoother. If your thinking of getting PAYDAY 2 go ahead it is brilliant and you wont regret it! Thanks for reading!",1

2014,"[EDIT] I have since solved this problem!!! I have windows 7, here's how to fix the problem (It's very easy). Simply hover your mouse over Trove on the taskbar and it should show you a 'preview' of what's meant to be on your screen now, simply right-click on the small slot and click 'maximise'. Then it will show up! I believe that it was just so tiny that I couldn't see it or press maximise. [EDIT]10/10 would get a game that shows you the intro screen.1. Started listening to the most amazing electro / dance mix ever.2 . Spent half an hour getting past Glyph's security measures (Although that was mostly my internet spazzing out).3. Was basically told that my password was awful.4. Finally signed up for Glyph and Trove.5. Installed Trove which was relatively quick.6. Opened the Glyph homepage for Trove.7. Noticed that you couldn't put it in fullscreen which didn't matter as it was the homepage.8. Was excited to finally play Trove.9. Opened Trove and pressed play but nothing happened. Sound was there and it said it was open but nothing except the homepage was on my screen.10. Finished listening to the most amazing electro / dance mix ever.Disappointed as it was an amazing looking game and had such good reviews, if anybody knows how to fix this could you please add me? :)",2

2013,"In super hexagon, you play as a small character known as point, along with another character known as hexagon. In this game you battle through endless waves of lines, colours, and truly awesome music. Use your skills to defeat your enemies such as line, triangle, square and pentagon, and battle to survive these shapes to get past the 60 second mark, allowing you to defeat each level. If you play this game, you will love it, hate it, and be extremely competitive over it, which is why it is so fascinating and rage inducing to play and watch. But, none the less, it is still a great video game that deserves a spot in your steam library, and like myself, might become one of you favorite games.I, Apricoat, supreme overlord of cheesecake, give this game a score of 8.25/10",1

2014,"I have chosen to write this review because it is the best map creator that I have ever used it has many great and easy features that you can use in this program. First off you think easy = bad but not in this program the many easy features in this program would change your map dramatically. You can make your maps and import it into unity or use there dlc's to make your game even better. The developer of the program is a great guy that will help you on Skype with anything and talk with you step to step by having him on Skype, this is better than sending an email to him because  it’s not email sent then wait a day to get a reply back etc.. it does take time to get used to some features in this program but not all of the features take time to learn, there are also tutorials that he has made to help you out, the developer is also very smart by taking an engine and making it into a game like so this makes the experience much more fun and rewarding. I defiantly recommend this game engine to everyone that would like to make a game and wants to have a blast making it.",1
2014,"This premium is a great dlc, it gives you the full capabilities that you need to make a great game, it also alows you to publish your game to the public this is a must buy if you want your game to be published",1
2014,"This is a great dlc for AGF, as AGF is no longer a map / level creator it turns it into a tabletop game maker, the amazing thing about BattleMat is that it has so much detail into it as you can even has a Randomizer with this you can chose your loot, quests and monsters, this isn't my favourite dlc but it is a good dlc, if you love to make and play a tabletop game that is built for miniature battles, you would have a blast at this, but if you like more of a fps I would recommend the zombie fps dlc.",1
2014,"Don't Starve, simple right? Wrong. In Don't Starve you play as Wilson (or any other charecter you unlock {that's right you unlock more charecters as you play!}) After a catastrofic science accident caused by a mysterious man named Maxwell which sent Wilson to a another world. Your main objective is ""don't starve"" which is difficult beause there are monsters, pigmen, spiders and other cruel beasts hunting you down.Story wise: There isn't much of a story in this game. All you have to do is survive. You can find worm holes throught the world and that tells you a bit of story but not a lot.6.5/10Graphics: 1 word: Magnificent. Don't Starve's graphics are best played on high. They look great with charecter animations, enemy animations or Wilsons' surroundings. Plus all the animations are hand drawn which looks great! 9.5/10Sound: It's fantstic from cutting down trees to slaying spiders or pigmen. Every footstep sounds different whenever Wilson steps foot different terrians. 9.5/10Overall: Don't Starve is a great game overall. It's just the story need to have some work done on it. 9/10 (Must Buy)",1

2014,"I got this game just after it was released, and when I was playing then it was fun, but was lacking substance. What I mean is, I kept hitting brick wall, after brick wall really early on, and spent a lot of time waiting, this was around when the developers said they were up to 10% of the games potential. I stopped playing for ages, and just started a couple of days ago again, (now up to 51%) and it is SO much better now. There has been a lot of really well thought out updates to prevent waiting around, as well as cleaning up, and adding another race. I am also glad I had to restart so I could learn all the new things. I am still early on, so unsure if this is already in the game, but I would really like to see something like a warrior type person, or someone that could fight the champions on voyages or scare of the party people. Overall though, this game has improved A LOT, and is well worth playing, its enjoyable, and its great to just let things sit while you go out, and come back and see all the progress!AS it is at the moment, I would still rate this an 8/10, it will definitely become a 10/10 game as soon as everything is complete.Keep up the good work guys!P.S. The developer commentary is very helpful as well as very natural sounding.",1
2014,"This game has a lot of potential, and is extremely fun to explore and try and survive. One thing I would really enjoy though, is perhaps some caves which larger predators can not fit into, and not sure if this is already in there as I havent clocked up many minutes/hours. But the ability to climb trees, or a tree house in which to shoot from would be amazing! any way 9/10 at the moment, can not wait to see what gets added and how it turns out in the end. Awesome job guys!!",1

I reckon that borderlands 2 is the best game i have even played and i think i'l be playing it for a long time to come.,1

It took me a bit long to finish this game than I had excecpted but I finished it off and I thoroughly enjoyed this game! can't wait to play the next game. This game has alot of action in it and creepy dark rooms, with blood stainds all over the wall, but it isn't just all action and glamor. There is a really good quailty story line, and to be honest it has one of the best storylines ive play in ages so to rap it up 'Would you kindly', go and play this amazing game.",1

2014," CASTER On the surface, Caster is a generic third-person shooter with absolutely horrid graphics.Have you heard of a little phrase that goes ""Don't judge a book by it's cover""? I know its cliche, but, Caster fits into that little phrase perfectly.Play beyond the original generic shooting and bad graphics and you'll find several fun and interesting things.To list a few:A fun and smooth movement systemInteresting and diverse enemy typesPower-up abilities AND enemies that affect the terrain of the levelA multitude of different levels, with community support for even more levelsTo be honest, I've had more fun with this game than some games that cost 10x the amount this does, mainly because of the mechanics it includes that, on paper, seem game-breaking and/or horrible but actually make the game extremely fun. For example, in one of the first few missions, I was running along when I run into this huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scorpion thing that comes out of the ground and shoots a giant reflective ball at me. Naturally, I move out of the way of the ball and look to where it lands and realise that it just created terrain. I swear I spent about 15 minutes just screwing around with what was now my new best friend and making what was once a grassy plain into a deslote wasteland full of mountains. Its that sort of thing that makes me love this game. Not to mention, not long after that mission, you get a powerup that lets you shoot, get this: THE BALLS THE FREAKING SCORPIONS CAN SHOOT. That point is the happiest any game has ever made me feel. However this powerup is a little unbalanced, as it does ridiculous amounts of damage AND is AOE. Basically, this game is full of silliness like that and it is surprisingly fun. I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to screw around with a game.",2

2014,"*This is more of a first impressions review, I have not gotten very far and may or may not edit this review later*Saying Pixal Piracy is Terraria but with pirates is nowhere near giving this enough credit. This game clearly has complexity far beyond Terraria.No, a better way to describe it is... an adventure micro-manage-it-up. With the many abilities, crew, weapons and ship parts, this has potential stuck up the wah-freakin'-zoo not to mention that daunting hunger system, that some players may find a tad too hard, and the cleaning and repairing and the fishing and the...Ok, I'll stop.Basically, this is a complex game, from what I've seen so far. If you aren't ready to micro-manage the hell out of stuff, you may find yourself being confused and getting yourself into an infinite loop of starving to death. (Like me)Overall, Pixal Piracy has a lot of potential and if you're fine with buying games that are still in development, and are all good with micro-managing, I highly recommend this as it is a super fun game.",2

2014,"I love the older feel to this game; it reminds me of the many similar games I used to play growing up (Legend of Zelda, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana...). It also brings a lot more creation to you for your character, allowing you to customise your appearance and choose the way you level your abilities/skills (one of the main reasons I love RPGs). Not to mention that you can play with 3 other people, who make their own unique characters too. My brother and I bought this game yesterday and have had a blast playing it together, which was quite helpful as some of the boss fights would be a real pain by myself; farming for crafting materials too.Of coarse it is still in the beta and there are a few paths that are blocked off as the next map has literally not been added to the game yet, but my concern at this point, is worry for how big this game will be; My brother and I haven't played that long (though it has been a few hours) and it appears that we are about halfway through the story. You can have up to nine characters, but there isn't a whole lot you can do different between plays (you can make it more difficault and play alone for a real challenge or try a different build for your character) and I fear I may get board once I've finished the game once or twice, but thats just me; others might like shorter games.Having said that, I have no idea what the creators plan and what plot twist there could be, which could have this game spiralling much deeper and longer than it appears; my hope is for a game at least as long as the games I mentioned above. It is in beta after all, and so far I love this game.",1

2014,This game is absolutely amazing! I'm waiting for Half-Life 3!,2
2013,Better than COD:GOMy ♥♥♥♥ bleeds on playing this game.,1

2014,"rogue legacy is a down right fun game, it's good for casual gaming, but also for sinking hours into, its packed with a great amount of difficulty, a great amount of content and a great amount of love put into the game. rogue legacy is gleaming with joy and character.buy it. and have fun.",2
2014,"just another epic step in the Elder scrolls series, the game will give you hundreds of hours of enjoyment and supports a ton of mods to customise it any way you like",1
2014,"I was pleasently suprised how much i enjoyed this game i got it cheap in a humble bundle, the combat system is fun and easy to use and the open world type gameplay is a really good way to kick back and get lost in the story for a few hours",1
2014,A very well made retro looking adventure game with a twist I had a ball playing through this.,1

2014,Hold on to your helmets kiddies this War of the Vikings is going to get big,1
2014,Ok game but not worth $15 in my opinion. Get this game when its on sale or from a discount website.,1
2014,I have no idea what people are talking about when they say the game crashes because it has not crashed once for me. I run it as low settings and 720x480 because I am running integrated graphics and the game still looks great. The story is rubbish but the gameplay is excellent,1
2014,"Ever since C.W.A (for those who were STAR WARS: The Clone Wars fanatics would know) got shut down, this is basically somewhat of a second resort so yeah. :/ Beats the flash games on the Star Wars Official Website.",2
2014,Absolutely an amazing piece of work.,2
1993,"Mix or Roblox,DayZ,Minecraft and Rust",2
2014,awesome!,2
2014,This game was onistly very very bad i like crysis 2 and 3 but this one was i am just going to say it ♥♥♥♥ it crashed a lot it inpossible to win because every 5 minutes a helicopter would show up the tank battles where ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because you would shot one tank it would take one hit then the next tank 10 hits and then you run out of ammo and it is still not destroyed so it was not aavery good game. P.S. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.,2

1994,Awesome game definitely recommended,2
2014,This game is so awesome but i would be much better with friends,2
2014,"I will preface this review by stating that this is not a bad game. It is NOT a bad game. In fact, this game is amazing, and if you have never played Heroes before this game is my suggestion as to where you should start the journey. The reason for my down vote is simply because I paid $17 for nostalgia and that's pretty much it. Granted the graphics are better, but they weren't ever truly terrible for what the game was, and I feel overall not much else was done for it. It does not include all content which only adds to further disappointment and unless you're playing against people of your skill level, multiplayer is a joke (if it even works). The only solution I can see to correct this problem is to release the other 50% of the game (yes, the additional content accounted for pretty much 50% of the game) for free to those who have currently purchased the game and to add the random map generation.Whilst I still enjoy playing the game it's disappointing to know how unfinished this rerelease is, especially when it is an obvious cash-grab rereleasing a game for today's desktops.",1

2014,"this game... this game is beautiful. i cannot express my feelings well enough, to describe what i felt when playing this game.  i laughed, i cried, laughed and cried alot more. the soundtrack was amazing and it made the game a tearjerker. never have i ever felt such a connection to the characters in this story than any other game. 10 out of 10 this is a beautiful game that everyone should play",1

2014,"Unfortunetly, every time i go to do something on this game/behind the scenes. It always sends me staright to the review sectionand it never lets me go anywhere from there. It's a real shame because im a big fan of portal 2, and i was very interested, but it may not work for some users i supose. :(",1

2014,"One of the best games of all time, I have been a fan since the launch of Tomb Raider: Legends and getting my hands on this was a god send. After purchesing it on all platforms I own, it consistantly continues to satisfy my platformer adiction.Now that it has come to my primarel mac computer, I couldn't be happier. Great for anyone seeking an awesome adventure platformer. It is a must have, you will get many hours of joy out of it. I only wish they would port all the others to mac also. ;)",1
2014,"Great game, it needs some time to learn to work with all of the weapons. Though I wouldn't know anything about that because I have focused on getting the best skins, stickers, knives + at least 20 nametags because that's what a FPS is really about. ily Valve <3",2
2014,"Very good game infact for a while there it was one of the only games i played, I love it and think that there are obvious room for improvement (which may or may not have been fixed in Rugby Challenge 2 but im not sure) but all in all it really is a good game. Controls are easy to get used to and the difficulties are great for inexperienced players and experienced players all the same.",2

2014,"ESPAÑOLFuera de la lentitud y etc que me causa la internet, tiene mecanicas que si bien son realistas no te ayudan en nada ponerlas en un juego asi.la fuerza que se genera al moverte no es igualitaria a la velocidad a la que uno va, la camara es un default horrible que no se gasta siquiera en seguirte la mira, el juego (para mi) es muy lento en cuanto ataque y conquista (y si bien esta leveleado) la minima diferencia entre mejoras de naves y etc no te deja tener ni igualdad ni ventaja dentro de una partida. el juego esta pesimamente llevado a cabo.  Se nota que es una muy buena idea pero le metieron mil cosas que no lo ayudan en nada, esta mal hecho el Sistema de pre carga y para colmo los precios son excesivos en cuanto a las recompensas que el juego ofrece por mision/ logro.iIgualmente es mi opinion.Repito hoy me funcionó mal y cuando ME FUNCIONÓ se me hizo imposible ignorar todo esto que dije. Entre ayer y hoy juge minimo 4 partidas (completas como incompletas) y me fue suficiente como para saber que este juego no es para mi",0
2014,"Arma 3 is one of the greatest games I have ever played. Apart from being my 2nd most played game on steam, I have been completely astounded by the amount of accessable gamemodes and innovative RP's that are playable.

2014,Отличная игра за 129 рублей. Своих денег стоит.+Карточки+Геймплей+РеиграбельностьВобщем очень много плюсов.Для меня минус 1 всего это:-129 рублей ;-),2
2014,"От себя добавлю то что данную игру выйграла на сайте SteamGifts.comИ да игра на самом деле очень интересная ;) Своих денег стоит. Рекомендую к покупке по скидке.+ выпадает 3 штучки Steam Trading Cards«Новые люди - новые идеи»Пока ""большие"" разработчики хвастаются количеством полигонов в моделях персонажей, а издатели жадно считают денежки, независимые студии создают непризнанные шедевры. Они имеют ограниченные ресурсы и бюджет, но даже с мелочи возможностей выжимают максимум. Надеюсь, что в будущем ситуация изменится, и таких творцов обязательно поддержат не только игроки, но и честные издатели.Сегодня хочу представить замечательный независимый проект под названием Chronology. Игра создана небольшой студией Osao Games. Она представляет из себя приключенческий платформер, приправленный множеством головоломок.«Наука на каждом шагу»Сюжет этой игры каждый может трактовать по-своему. Для меня - это история о великой силе, которой через человеческий эгоизм и несовершенство не место в этом мире. Хоть это и не открывается сразу в центре перед игроком, но это та база, та истина, ради которой мы и будем проходить игру.Разочаровавшись в своем учителе, главный герой, профессор Алхимии собирает манатки и отправляется в путешествие, чтобы исправить их с учителем ошибку. За время беготни по лесу на начальном уровне профессор находит себе друга - Улитки, который в течение игры будет его самым помощником. Эти события и является нашей отправной точкой в длинное путешествие, полной приключений.«Бегай, прыгай, время гони»Геймплейные составляющая от жанровых рамок игры далеко не отходит, хотя и разбавленная всевозможными манипуляциями со временем и интересными головоломками, но это просто констатация факта. Несколько слов о головоломки. Они не являются какими-то слишком сложными, а направлены скорее на человеческое внимание (то есть на полное ее отсутствие), а также на сообразительность и находчивость.Скажу честно, мне понадобилось немного привыкнуть к подобному, ведь после игр, где думать не принято, довольно трудно было настроиться на общее настроение и темп игры. Игры со временем, для меня неудивительно, нечто подобное было и в том же Braid, а также в одном из моих любимых шутеров - Singularity. Есть создатели не изобретали велосипед, а просто воспользовались опытом других разработчиков. Но надо отдать им должное, они все же смогли гармонично соединить все свои замыслы в одном художественном произведении. Основу же игры составляет, как всегда, беготня и прыжки. Это может и надоесть, но уже на финальных титрах, если вы не застрянете на каком-то квесте.«Мир, где соприкасаются"" до ""и"" после ""...»Нам дают возможность поиграть со временем, то есть мы можем ""перемотать"" вперед или же обратно. Мало того, что это очень интересная и важная геймплейные фишка, да еще и такая возможность в корне может изменить представленную нами локацию. Так называемая временная рамка before (до) - показывает нам живую и яркую картинку. А after (после) - представляет нам темный и разорен уровень.Получается, что мы в любой момент можем увидеть два альтернативных мира. Но несмотря даже такое многообразие на некоторых уровнях разработчики немного перестарались с красками. Особого внимания заслуживают кат-сцены, хотя они и представлены здесь в качестве рисунков, но их качество просто шедевральная, они не только радуют глаз ай дополняют пробелы в сюжете, сразу чувствуется рука мастера. Chronology имеет стандартную для жанра графику. Перед нами замечательный акварельный стиль и опрятный визуальный ряд. Есть канонов игра соблюдает.«Качественного музыкального стиля трудно и представить»Звуковое сопровождение в Chronology ласковый и ненавьязлививий. Музыка не только подчеркивает общее настроение игрушки, но и предоставляет дополнительные ноток атмосфере. К озвучке также нет никаких претензий, голоса главных героев и второстепенных персонажей полностью соответствуют их характерам.http://Источник",2

Combat is basic but never gets old since you're constantly feel like a character in the manga/anime, pulling off crazy moves against crazy powerful foes. This is a fantastic game that I recommend playing if you're a dragon ball fan.",1
2014,"This game is absolutely incredible and I cannot wait for the future updates. There is a lot more that the developers can do such as : Extra NPCs (bears, sharks etc.)  Make the caves dangerous and something you have to prepare for. (Almost like a raid maybe?) Add extra features to the clans (better identification and base building etc.)So far I have encountered a few people and the game makes it an interesting moment every time, you must find out if they are friendly and be prepared if they are not. Even without other people this game is intense and interesting, there are so many places to explore and so many things to do.I am really looking forward to the future updates of this game.(Check out my screenshots to see some of my ingame adventures.)",1
2014,"Well the game was[/u] good. And then they gone and done messed up with this stupid update, turning the game into a crappy pay 2 win [Pay2Day]. Not only have they made it possible to boost guns if you buy them, they've turned the entire game into an economy, similar to CS:GO and TF2. Not only does this detract from the game it makes the game less about excellent gameplay, team-spirited heists and challenging missions, and more about some skins wish truthfully look quite crap. Ordinarily I would recommend this game to anyone, and I have on several occasions, but now you gone and done messed up. Devs have gotten far too greedy, first with 30 freakin DLC's and now with bloody micro transactions inserted in the game. Not only have the DLC's progressively gotten worse and made the game less about cohesion and more about $$$, we have micro-transactions for greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can get more cash in their pockets. Well you can f*k right off",1

2014,"Probably the best game on the genre. You can build anything you want if you are a builder, or you can enjoy cool monster and boss fights if you like the dangerous side of the life (YAY). I've got over 1000 hours of gameplay on Terraria, like playing alone, editing custom maps and multiplayer co-op adventure or PVP. This game is awesome. With a awesome team working on its mechanics and sprites, and the great community that the game have, you'll feel like you're at home. I give a 10/10, cause it's completely awesome!PROS: - Boss fights!- Game biomes make it always different.- NPCs!- Every world is different.- +1000 ITEMS!CONS:- Finite worlds.- Don't have a story.- Don't have a local ""Creative Mode"" (you have to download a certain Mod)- Don't have QUESTS (actually there is a new Angler NPC who asks if you can catch certain type of fish, but I mean REAL quests, like the RPG ones)",2

1992,"Sorry for this long review, if you dont wont to read, then all the other ine sentence reviews should convince you to get this game. this is pretty much just details on the game itself and my thoughts on them. i dont think i get really specific so if you wanna know more just go to the wiki or the play guide http://store.steampowered.com  Pros (in my opinion, obviously) Most Classic RPG experiance in an MMO that ive had in a while. its its pretty rare these days where you start off as an actual  normal adventurer and get quests from an adventurers guild. these days most mmos are just replica of ""you are a chosen one! now go fight evil"" sorta thing. The combat system is about the same as the standard good old formula, has som pretty animations for combat as well. The Gear and weapons have a nice aesthetic feeling to them and they get the look of the gear right as well, going from begginners gear to higher level gear, it actually matches what it looks like in comparison to the level. no flashy beginners gear. to bad that there is no costume slots so you can use the image of old gear, but most of them look great to begin with. A great part of the class mechanics is that once you reach lvl15 on your first class, you can choose to pick up any other class and conintue with that, of course starting from level one again. but if you dont want to do this you can always start a new character, since they give a generous amount of character slots per world (at least after the ifrst month of paid sub). The Story is quite typical of a final fantasy game, chocka block full of characters and plot. since i play most games while listening to something,  i usually dont pay much attention to what the npc's say and just follow quest obj, but this has probably been one of only 10 or so games that i dont do that. Animations, Graphics and Design of Final Fantasy 14 are quite good, if you look around you realise that every npc, wheteher they be friend or enemy, has a ton of idle animations and animations while being interacted with. for me who uses a pretty low end pc (basically what the minimum it states, maybe a bit lower) its still looks quite beautiful. The Environment and world itself is quite expansive,though it is section off into different regions. For example Thanalan (name of whole region) -> split into North, South East, e.t.c There is thankfully no game breaking pay to win gear. though there is gear that you can by with real money, its aesthetic stuff like mounts and costumes. basically all you can by with real money is -> The game itself + paid DLC ( which so far is only heavensward), the sub needed to play and aesthetic stuff like premium dyes, mounts, nostalgic costumes and little pets that will follow you around.Also if you happen to be a japanophile like me you can hav Jap audio with english sub. just saying, but theres nothing wrong with the english voice actors, they're acutally pretty good. Cons i wished that they would add more voices to the cutscenes and general talking to npcs, because so far only important mission cutscenes have voice.maybe no sub fee or a lower one, its pretty heavy on my wallet since i play alot. hahahasometimes around really big updates the launcher freaks out and does a bunch of erros and you'll end up redownloading it or searching the internet for an answer.",1
2014,"The game was good the first time I played it but I forgot about it for a while. Bout a year later when I went to play and reinstall it, the app kept crashing no matter what I did. Even confirming the content never worked nor did the app ever fix. Just so you know the app wouldnt open and then close: Steam would begin the startup and crash it. There would be no homepage for the game or music, just the annoying box that said the app crashed. When I would search online there would be no browser open to fix it. Either my computer is stupid as all hell or it is just a broken game.",0

It was fun at some points and very zelda esque which is a really nice touch with the pieces of heart and the treasure after a boss, though i still found that my save file being deleted was way too big of a set-back so i can't really recommend it, though if you happen to pick it up you will atleast enjoy it.",1
2014,"-Don't mind my hours spent, I've clocked crapton of hours on Xbox 360.-Review on SP only.Dead Island is no stranger to the zombie mania. It's a definite win for avid zombie fans and is a reminiscence for the good old times. Dead Island has an array of features not only the brain dead zombies per se but also weapon crafting, somewhat open-world experience and at times, mowing down horde of zombies with a rusty car. It's a great game indeed and deserve the accolade as TMoZG. [As if that acronym exist] On the other hand, unlike the console platform, the PC platform does have it's flaws. In hindsight, the game does stutters due to poor optimization even with a GTX 760. But then again, that's about it. Oh, totally not for the weak-hearted. Compared to Dead Island Riptide, this stands out. Nothing beats the original that's for sure. Having said all of these, Dead Island does pumped me up for Dying light and Dead Island 2 as a starter kit.",1

And with my Australian internet it took me 2 and a half days to download the rest, so I can't comment on how bad it was day one. However, it still could use a bit of work but the game is still very much playable. I can run the game on most of the normal graphical settings fine (And my rig isn't even that great really). People just seem to be ♥♥♥♥♥ing about not having and absolutly polished 100% game.

2014, Darksouls Scholar of the First Sin   Darksouls Scholar of the First Sin  was ment to be 20x harder I only found it a bit harder then the original but  in the ways they made it harder they also made it easier. New players just picking up darksouls 2 Scholar of the First Sin will have a hard time because the enemies just swarm you its not 1 enemy then 1 enemy etc etc like it was in darksouls 2. OVER ALL SCORE  Hardness   7.5/10 - Much more difficult with the addition of more NPC invades altho they removed a lot of features from 2 (to try and balance it out). Players that are new to darksouls (Haven't player the other 2) will find this really hard  Enjoyment  8/10 - I had a lot of fun playing thing over it was fun knowing that the enemies were in different places  and i didnt really know what to expect. Allt hough it was still darksouls 2 but changed it a bit more so not as fun as picking up a new souls game and doing a blind run,2

2014,ok after finally getting in last night i died from starvation 3 times. they need to up the loot a bit more for everyone is dieing. it is quite funny but also annoying if you actually want to progress. i love th ecombat system makes you feel like you can actually survive one on one with a zombie. after i found a axe my life became easier i was cutting trees making campfires and cooking  up poor bambi in no time at all and purifying my water made it feel like a sense of achievement.i recommend this game on the basis i know it is alpha and will keep on improving.,1
2014,Excellent to see SE bringing more Final Fantasy games to PC! Please do listen to everyone's feed back and better address issues such as locked frame rates and other limited graphics options... Almost running out of excuses to not have those seeing as new titles brought to steam are probably planned ahead of console releases these days.,2

2014,"Rust is a social experiment. Anything you craft in-game can, and probably will be raided and stolen, no matter the defenses. People will add you to their friends list for the sole purpose of knowing if you're offline or not in-game, so as to determine the perfect time to steal all your items. Rust is a soul-crushing digital manifestation of what happens when the world breaks down and guns and explosives are the only form of barter or negotiation.It is a beautiful game. The sunrises and sunsets are majestic.What it does to people. however, is the exact opposite. Rust is a more brutal, unforgiving, and relentless online arena than EvE Online - as even in EvE. you could park your assets in a neutral station and wait for the storm to pass. Here, the storm is everywhere... right outside your door, crawling on your ceiling, while you're asleep in your bed. Waking up to find your assets intact in Rust can be considered a major accompishment, and usually only practical for those in large clans which cross multiple time zones.Copy Pasta",1

2014,"Very fun and accurate ww2 combat simulator. Unlike other games, to be good at War thunder requires an immense amount of skill and it really shows in your performance in matches.

2014,"Este juego sin dudar una obra maestra la verdad cuando juego me entusiasmo mucho y es muy entretenido porque puedes correr, trepar, saltar hasta hacer piruetas es un juego que la verdad vale la pena descargarlo",1
2014,"where to start, right this is a robocraft a game purely for building and fighting other robots that can have different terrain mobility, for example a basic one is wheels, they start at an early level of tier 1 (level 1) and go all the way up to the highest level of tier 10 (level 10), their are 6 categories of movement, hovers, walkers, wheel, treads, aerofoils and skies now i won go in to detail about all of them cause thats what YoU have to find out! now remember this game is still in pre-alpha which means it is not in full realse so their is a few bugs here and their but nothing that stands out to the fact of how good freejam has made this game. to be honest at the start it is quiet boring but once you get to tier 3 - tier 5 it gets a whole lot more interesting. if you like world of tanks, the blocky images in minecraft and is able to use your imagination to the fullest, then i defiantly suggest this game to you!ardeous-Briz",1

2014,"Absolutely fantastic game! Captivating story, great gameplay, and characters that make the expirience even better! It gets difficult occasionally, but only to the extent that when you complete the mission/task/whatever, you achieve a sense of acomplishment. The plot is incredibly well thought out, with twists and turns at every corner. In fact, the only thing better than the story, is the gameplay itself. After a little getting used to, the combat becomes enjoyable. Whether you're taking on a few thugs, a titan, or both at once, i can guarantee that you will find it entertaining. The upgrade system has improved significantly from what it was in arkham asylum. I'm not going to lie, using the cryptographic sequencer was a bit of a struggle, but after more frequent use, became an exellent adition to batman's repetoire of gadgets. And then there's the voice acting. Absolutely amazing. The cast was perfect, and all portrayed the characters brilliantly. The only thing that i dislike about this game was that it ended. Game of the Year is an understatement. This is one of the greatest games ever made. Whether you're a fan of batman, or not, this game will prove to be a fantastic expirience that you will never forget. Thank you rocksteady, for creating the best supehero game ever made.",2
2014,"Jesus Christ, i don't know where to begin with Hotline Miami. I'll start by saying it's difficult. Really difficult. You will die ALOT! Within 5 hours i got an achievement for dying 1000 times. It will be frustrating, but it will be addictive, and you will have an amazing sense of accomplishment when you manage to clear the more difficult levels. I recommend playing in short bursts. Maybe two ot three levels at a time. Unfortunately, this is unlikely. it is so much fun to play that you will trick yourself into playing for longer than you should.But yeah, recommended. 9/10Try not to die too much.",2
2014,"Free is too expensive for this game. Hell, i probably wouldn't even play it again if i was payed. I've played this game for about thirty minutes. That was all i needed.",2

2014,"I don't like Ocarina of Time anymore anyway.....--Do you remember those games that you played, that immersed you so much you almost seemed to lose track of real life?Well saying that about Undertale would be a crude understatement. I don't want to spoil this game for any one who hasn't played it, but in short Undertale is a RPG that's willing to take everything you know about the genre, and challenge it to a godlike level, while still remaining a ""Role-Playing Game"". As you play, be wary of the term 'Role-Playing', as you may find that as time goes on your part in the game is more than just a mere 'role'.I genuinely love this game, and hope it's appreciated for years at the very least, because there isn't a single RPG (out of 100's of classics I myself have played, like Chrono Trigger, FF7 etc.) that has handled emotion and character development as well as Undertale.P.S. Avoid tumblr posts before you play it, if possible?",1

You get to choose to be between a counter terrrist which are people that prevents terrorists from planting a bomb or using a hostage as bait, as terrorist is when you get to plant the bomb and try not to get the counter terrorist from defusing it or trying to get the counter terrorist away from rescuing the hostages. This game is a great way to make new friends and also experience what it is like, the graphics are unbeleivably amazing and the recoil makes it feel soo realistic.

1987,"So far this game looks like it will be really good when it is complete or atleast with a few more levels and features added to it, and it's less of a game and more of a eye opening first person movie, which reacts to ur inputs, which is probably the easiest way to say it.So far there are three charecters, which are more like three points through your life. Young child Grown (working) Adult ElderlyThe levels are very short at this point of the games early access stage, though the child level was a bit rage endusing, and took a little bit longer to complete, it is still very short. the biggest factor of this game, is the concept, and ""view""by this I mean what the game seems like it is trying to convey, and what it seems to be about. The three charecters show how the three big stages of life, and how our perspective of life changes throughtime, the child turns everything into a challenge, and everything dull, into somthing bright and fun, then the adult, nothing is very fun, all the bright things in life are now gone, forgotten or ruined, and your only goal is to get to work and earn your paycheck, and then the last, retirment, the elderly, where every thing is a forced challenge, and is grey and empty, and your vision is hazy, the game does a great job showingthis, and is jut going to bet biger, longer and better, this is a game that you should deffinently keep your eye on, and you should also download it now and ive it a shot.",1

2014,"Really fun gameplay and incredibly interesting graphics make this game an awesome title to pick up, coupled with it's good soundrack, sound design and story. It's also the right length and has interesting story arcs and twists, upgrading and collecting is fun to forge new armor and attachments, and isn't farmy at all. The main characters have their moments and are well thought out, while some minor characters are a bit annoying and not acted well. Replayability is there, but there isn't much to do after you've collected all the Friends from other indie games.All in all, buy it. On sale? It's usually three bucks, but waiting for a sale isn't worth it for this game. Buy it right now.",1

2014,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter game, multiplayer is a major part of the game as there is really no story involved but it's one of those games you can play from time to time for enjoyment to let off some steam maybe. Casual is a nice way to enhance your skill cap and to get better game sense and knowledge, the competitive aspect of this game is really reliant on teamwork, communication and skill which is why I really enjoy playing this with friends which is recommended.

Game is simply waaaaay to fast, level design and gameplay looks like my old project from my grade 11 game design course, in other words, so basic, bland and generic that all you have to do is change the sprite of the main character and you can make the game anything you wish, and nobody would care.

This game kicks you straight in the balls as soon as you start playing by making it a requirement to buy Half-life 2 (Both the first and the two episodes) as well as Counterstrike to run any map. You'll begin to find ""User made content"" which is the only thing actually holding this game up - albeit barely. Though majority of the time you're going to have to restart the game to use them if they were downloaded mid-game - but don't get me wrong. They are pretty good. What you're going to find with the game itself, is that opening a map is going to take anywhere from 2-30 minutes - though you (The reader, don't get technical with me about this - I'll cut you -) may not experience this. This game is also prone to multiple crashes while playing, this can be anything from a minor annoyance, to a complete game-boner-killer. These crashes are NOT one-off occurances though, they are actually rather common. If you are like... well, any one else, then you'll sit back, maybe twiddle your thumbs for a while, and wait in complete, awe-inspiring boredom as NOTHING happens, all in the vein hope that maybe, ""It's different this time, it won't crash!"" though, just like New Vegas, the game is going to laugh as you sit there, like a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot waiting for some miracle that will make your game work.But hey, that's just MY experience. If you still think that buying this game is a good idea, go ahead and buy it. If not, then I am sorry that you had to hear from me how ♥♥♥♥ this game is.Yours sincerely, Narasha - The Bane of Games",1
2014,"Telltale's ""The Walking Dead"" suffers from the same weakness that most other games made by Telltale suffer: it's linear, and somewhat boring. The Walking Dead is set in a world cursed by the demons, ""Screen Tearing"" and ""Poor FPS"", in one of the several universes of this franchise. Despite how good this game looks, it is surprisingly linear: your making a decision, be it good or evil - kill Sally Lou, or leave her be - has no meaning: for if you decide to go for the Good option, someone else in the group will do whatever they need to do to make sure that the Bad option is undergone shortly before chastising you for being a ♥♥♥♥♥-less ♥♥♥♥ - or on the other end, where you'll choose the evil option, the exact same person from scenario 1 will chastise you for being a pussly-less, murdering ♥♥♥♥.The game tries to sell itself by facading as a ""Choose your own Adventure Game"", when what's really offered is more along the lines of ""Choose what you want to say to (x) to make them feel gooey inside, or tell them that you don't like them as a person, but offer them a lolipop so they feel all gooey inside about being hated by the One Black-Man to survive the apocalypse.Ultimately, this game lies to your face: it hints that it has tonnes of replay value, when in reality, it does nothing to draw you into the game after buying it - you'd get a better service for your dollar by hiring a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and asking her to hug you for half of her purchased hour, and asking her to leave shortly thereafter.If this review seems long, then that is because I'm an angry Australian ♥♥♥♥ who can't quite be ♥♥♥♥ed to reread his writing, but just isn't lazy enough to leave this game review-less.Overall score: 3/10 - would bang again.",1
2014,"Counterstrike: Global Offensive truly differs from the other modern AAA shooters that are released. PROS:-CS:GO has a variety of game modes that appeal to the general fan base of first person shooters (Such as Deathmatch and Arms race) but keeps its core focus on the classic 5V5 diffuse mission that every Counterstrike fan knows and loves.-The game encourages team tactics and cooperation between team mates, which can be difficult due to the occasional prat who decides to wedge the bomb inbetween the car next to T spawn and a wall. But when you DON'T have a team mate with the IQ of a drooling two year old you can effectively develop stratergies that work with your team , whether its full of strangers or some of your closest friends. Friendships are made!-The mechanics of the game push a new player through a steep learning curve with difficult recoil control or making sure they stay fairly quiet, both of these things can ruin first impressions but can easily be learnt and adapted to over time.-There is a wide variety of maps with ocasional DLC coming out every season containing new maps and weapon skin cases.CONS:-The ""Valve Anti-Cheat"" doesn't seem to be working that well Gabe, now, this may just be a personal issue seeing as the servers you auto-connect to depend on your region (The oceanic reigon for yours truly). But I constantly run in to people with obvious aim-cheats, wall-cheats etc etc which really ruins the game.-I got a ban for ""kicking too many people in previous games""...excuse me? I consider myself to be a pretty fair guy and I understand that not everyone can 4K clutch, so I only vote to kick someone if they're doing worse than a BOT would or being a giant ♥♥♥♥, in these cases, these players were being tremendous knobs (killing team mates, throwing the bomb into unreachable places, playing rap music down their microphone etc) Therefore I the teams I was playing on came to a mutual agreement to kick the players, I just think the reason for the ban is a load of cack.-Aaah yes, Skin cases, now, I'm not really considering this a ""con"" as its not Valves fault for making me spend that much money T.T only open cases/crates if you have the money! You will regret itDespite the couple of negative things I had to say, I give counterstrike a whole heartedly 9/10, if a game can make me as angry as this one can, it means it deserves a pretty solid rating. I recomend this game to any one thinking of getting it but with a warning, this game is harder to learn than your average shooter, don't go in with the mind-set that you're going to wreck people in your first day, you won't, and thats good, its just the beggining soldier.",0
2014," This game is a joke. Warface is a try-hard, want to be Call of Duty with clunky, awful gameplay whilst trying (and failing) to implement tactical features and functions. Warface also has one of the worst Pay-2-Win systems I have ever experienced and actually makes me cringe to the core. There is an in-depth review below but the bottom line is; Don't play it. In-Depth Review  Gameplay Like I said above, the gameplay is clunky and doesn't ""flow"" well. I often find that sprinting makes my screen clanky and jagged and when I shoot my weapon it seems too.....rough? Pardon my low-effecient vocabulary. Tactical Play (with some community banter) One of the tactical features in Warface is to help one of your poor-tasted buddies onto a higher ledge and vice versa. I don't think the Devs knew how sh*t their games community was going to be (hint: it's very similiar to COD, maybe even worse) These features seem tacky and useless, used just to add some ""innovation"" to their game. Pay-2-Win Never in my life have I played a game where I have to RENT an ingame gun and not have the choice to keep it permanently, despite all those hard-earned game duckets I spent on it. Note: I haven't played that much of the game and do NOT have a full understanding of the market system. EZ game EZ life I'm really bad at Call of Duty, like awful, so I assumed that I would be bad at this also, that was until I went on a 15 kill streak in my first game. I know the majority of FPS is all just ""point-n-shoot"" but come ON FAM, THIS IS TOO EASY! Theres next to no recoil control or bullet drop, you can kill some nerd across the map with a couple of well placed bullets from the standard, beginner assault rifle and the slide feature allows any skirken to slide inbetween my legs and topple me even if he has awful aim NO SOUTH-PACIFIC REGIONAL SERVERS WTF!?!?! Crytek seems to think the world is a weird, pacman sort of shape because they apparently don't know New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa etc exist because they didn't create any f*cking dedicated servers for them, this is a personal issue but it should be resolved regardless of how bad the rest of the game is. The Wrap-Up Game is bad, play Blacklight instead (That game is rad)",0
2014," BIG ALPHA REVIEW I came into playing the ""Big Alpha"" for Evolve with low expectations, I have never played a game thats in Alpha before and expected a broken, barely playabale piece of trash, but I can pleasantly say that the Alpha is surprisingly well polished! THE GOOD STUFF The gameplay is exciting, I often find myself on my toes, always alert for the ""Monster has startled the birds icon"" I couldn't wait to spring into action with my team mates. Playing as the monster is just as exciting, always on the prowl, sniffing out your enemies as you devour the wildlife and become so powerful, the hunters become the prey.The classes the game provides (Assault, trapper, medic and support). Everyone has their own job and if one falls, the hunters may find it difficult to survive. The class system makes it important for Teamwork to exist within the game, making it a very good game to play with friends.Even on low graphics (had to turn it down due to optimization issues, more on that later) the game looks great, enviroments are lush and the dark, gloomy time setting makes the games atnosphere that much better THE BAD STUFF I've read other reviews and forums and it seems that alot of people are having issues with the game, even with powerful systems, admitedly my system isnt 'Top Tier' but it's no scrap yard and I was having issues running the game on High, to get a smooth, enjoyable experience I had to turn the graphics down to Low. However I didn't expect much less, it is in Alpha after all.The loading times took ALONG time, I mean 10-15 minutes long just to get into a bloody level! I kept having audio issues, gun sounds repeatedly going off when I wasn't firing etc, quite irritating THE CONCLUSION It's good, its very good....FOR AN ALPHA, you need to keep that in mind when playing something that isn't a full release, the devs have already said they are continuing to add on to this game and have a very clean, polished game out in Febuary.I highly recomend this, unfortunately I am writing this on the last day, I will ofcourse try to get a couple more hours in, so lets hope the full game is as pleasant as this.",0
2014,"This is a genre defining strategy game which even the smartest of minds couldn't work out. Some of the intricate, extremely difficult and fun puzzles seen in bad rats has made a generation of gamers rage. The highly rendered environment immerses the player, who now thinks he is the rat. This game pushes even the very best gaming computers. Even the Atari 2600 couldn't handle the brilliant graphics that this game has to offer. Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge is the best game ever created. Because like they say, ""rats with bats can defeat fat cats sitting on mats.10.0, get it right IGN community.",1

2014,(I want the guy who develop the game to answer this) will there be a free multiplayer mod or multiplayer servers for the game i think it would be a great idea because noone would hack the game (mainly because goats can already fly in the game thanks to explosives)  anyway it would be appreciated if this is answered,2
2014,"unturned is a great game considering thats its free to play and personaly i like survival games such as rust but i'd rather play this    free game than playing a ten dollar game. Also Unturned is very creative with the items you can pick up and is one of the best free to play games if not the best survival games i've played in its early stages. But it has some down sides to it, although it's in its early stages it has some multiplayer bugs and glitches which makes the game hard to enjoy. Also it doesn't have any ""proper"" servers, i had to get my friends and i to make our own. And i don't really like the crafting setup because it is hard to know what to craft and how to make the items in the game. i know this game is still very early and is being made by one guy but hopefully in its complete stages the game will be one of the best survival games out there and will be enjoyed by millions...Good Luck with the game",2

1998,This game is amazing. The fact that this was made by a 16 year old blows my mind. Everything is perfect except for a few things but in sure they will be changed later on. 2 things I just want to say is that: 1. Please make world saves. 2. Please make cars run out of fuel slower than what they do. Other than that i love this game and i recommend you to get it.,1

2014,"Gaben is love, Gaben is lifeAs a child i always lived PC games, i used to beg my Dad to buy me games, i would pray to LORD GABEN at night, hoping that he would grant me sales.Gaben would always give me sales usually 75% off. I had all the Valve games and would constantly trade and open cases. Keys were expensive.My Father could hear me praying to gaben, he came in and smashed my computer against the wall, i was crying over the smashed up parts crunched up on the floor. I started on cry over the loss of my Gaming pc. I knew my Dad was jealous for my devoting to Gaben. I start to fall asleep. I feel a strange presence enter my room. I quickly woke up to find Gaben. standing next to my Bed. ""its gaben"" i loudly though to myself"". I am so happy to see him. Gaben then uses his powers to lift up my broken pc and repair it with his mind. I am so thankful that he did such a kind thing. Gaben then proceeds to walk up to me. He then whispers in my ear,"" this is my hat"", i threw my Ghastly gibus at him, he rejects it and bends me over the bed, he enters my his fat fingers into my pants. but went for my pocket instead and takes out my wallet, he uses his magic to grant me 95% sales on all the games on my wishlist. Then penetrates my wallet and takes $10 out it is expensive but i do it for gaben. it is uncomfortable. He then proceeds to take out a $50 note, in the irritation i scream out ""Fluttershy is best pony, not pinkie"". Gaben is furious now and throws me against the wall, which reveals a secret wall safe. He walks over to the safe and takes out all my money, then begins to penetrate my tight butt hole, it hurts but i do it for Gaben. The noise attracts my dad to the room. My dad enters the room and finds me bent over in the corner in tears of joy and pain, while he sees gaben thrusting my hard. Gaben turns to my dad and looks him dead in the eye and flies out the window and says his last words 'Gaben is love, Gaben is life', followed by, ""you will never resist my sales"". i am now nearly unconscious in satisfaction as drool flows out of my mouth and i am still curled up in a bent over position.",1

2014,"The most unfinished, unballenced, glitchiest game since battlefield 4. When they say ""Early Access"" they litterally mean that jack ♥♥♥♥ works. I spent two hours grinding for wood, built a log cabin and was about to place the final TWO blocks of the ninety required, and suddenly some mutants randomly spawned infront of me, killing me instantly.Overall i would rate this game a 2/10 the only reason its two and not motherf*cking 0, is that it lets you slap mutants with their own f*cking arms.This game is NOT worth $14.99 in its current stage and should not be on steam. In my opinion this Early Access game realease  is comparable to the release of ""The War Z"" Or ""infestation: survivor stories"" as it was renamed.The developers of both these games should have thought long and hard before releasing such a sh*tty unfinished game onto steam, and valve themselves should be ashamed to have this in their library.To sum up this review, You should SERIOUSLY do some solid research before purchasing this. At the time i purchased it you could not even save the game, which was not clearly stated ANYWHERE on the store page and was clearly a gigantic flaw. I realise this has now been adressed and in future perhaps the many flaws in this game will be, however in its current state it is unplayable unless all you wish to do is slash mutants appart and build trophies out of there body parts, or atttempt to go swimming and end up flying above the entire map (Because F*ck logic). This game was advertised as a REALISTIC SURVIVAL GAME. Im not sure about you, but i dont consider walking over a rock and suddenly falling to the ground dead realistic, however if thats what floats your boat i suppose this game would be an excelent buy.",1

2014,"Best game ever. After the first mission (Intro/tutorial kinda thing, only goes for a couple minutes) you get to free roam in a massive map with no restrictions or ""do this mission to unlock an area"" and destroy stuff. String cars to planes and watch it all explode. Base jumping, gliding, parachuting, skydiving, pretty much anything you could want to do with a grapple hook. Only downside is the missions are terrible. All of the stronghold takeovers are exactly the same, even the same order of doing things and the story isn't very immersive, but that gives way to mods. I usually don't install mods on games until I feel it is getting boring (Finished or almost finished it) but in just cause 2, pretty much the first thing I did after finishing 2 or 3 missions was install mods. (Grapple range+speed, HD clouds, HD sky and moon, etc) If you want the best experience, play on casual (Easy) because the only thing it really changes is how far your health regens, the harder difficulties make it easier to die, giving you less time to do awesome stunts.",2

Its a nice game to play for 5-10 minutes with friends, but you can get bored of it quickly. I dont recommend it as a platformer, but as a casual, lighthearted multiplayer game with a cool graphic style, nice music and an awesome gimmick.",2

All enemys are randomly generated, so if you and your friends go to a planet, nothing there will have a name until you make one up, and then others on the server can call it that too. You wont have much of an idea what enemy you are talking about unless there are names. The game feels really good and pretty smooth, although the FPS isn't the best. I feel that most of the races are solid, although i would never play as the apes, and the Avian race is definitely my favorite.",2

2014,"Stick to the mobile version, or play it on a Mac if you own one becasue that's the only way to access the DLC (The best part of the game and the only source of longevity past 6hrs). I wish I could've refunded back when I bought it but instead I just bought it through bluestacks. You're way better off playing this on any platform other than Steam/PC.",1

2014,"EDIT: only 2/3 weeks ago I used to play this game on medium quality with no lag, now I had to set it to its lowest graphical settings and cnt get more than 30fps, with lagspikes going down to 8 fps, I dont know wether it was one of the Updates, but if it was please fix this, it makes the game unbearable.Yes this game is alot of fun, however it needs quite some balancing.Allied Bots for example are useless. This makes 1v1 beacon battles in a Long Range Frigate (sniper) almost impossible.some modules a way OP others totaly underpowered (eg the reload time on Gunship modules removing negative effects is way too long while other ships can pretty much immediately debuff your ship again)Gunships are also too slow in my opinion, while any interceptor can juggle any other ship with ease if a pilot knows what he is doing, making them sometimes impossible to hit.Also there is not a very good Help section in the game and the online Wiki is incomplete (not to mention half russian)This game has a crapton of content though, many different modi and a great gameplay. It ranges from PVE missions over PVP arenas to (pretty much) OpenWorld space adventure. All in all 7 out of 10 stars.",1

It's just way to frustrating not to be able to do anything....I might just be stupid though.",1

2014,"Deffinately reccomend path of exile to those who wish to sit down and go into an amazing rpg experience.The pool of skills and passive abilities is amazing and the quality of gear for most zones is great.It's a bit tough currency wise in the game because you use your currency on your items as well, full re roll of item abilities no worries, found a nice piece of armour and its only normal sweet use an orb of chance, oh sweet it's rare now.One thing i do like is that classes can be decieving, like for instance the witch, if you stat her elementally and give her some energy shield boosts along with minions boosts she can be a heavy battle changer, kill a few enemies, raise about 5 minions, and 7 skeletons, have the abillity that gives monsters a boost in defence against the element you hit them with first and a 50% decrease in defence from all other elements, there we go we have ourselves a very powerful witch, but then again i've come to realise that in Path of Exile even you when hit the level cap if you wish you can play that character forever and still find those extra skill points to get to those other passive abilities you just couldn't reach with roughly 1 skill points.but you cant just run your character build off what I think is best, you have to explore your options and be wise about how you get to them, every skill point counts, one mistake could mean that your character loses some usefullness in battle I also like the way that you have 2 weapon equip slots, toggling between claws and a dagger and sword combo makes battle so much easier.9/10Gameplay is brilliant all in all.P.S shop is mostly cosmetic items apart from pets and guild chest slots",0

2014,"Age of Empires II was released in 1999 by Microsoft Games and Ensemble Studios. It is a classic RTS (Real Time Strategy) Game that made the favourites list of gamers everywhere. The HD Edition brings HD resolutions to the game, causing the refacing of all buildings, sprites, land features and water. The LAN Feature was removed when the multiplayer interface was made to be handled by Steam, however that is a minor drawback because the multiplayer interface in general has been given a good kick since it was transferred to Steam.For old and new fans of the classic 'Age of Empires' series, this is a must buy game, whether it be on sale or not.10/10",1

2014,"Disclamer: ONLY PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF PATIENCEThis is game is Amazing in my perspective. It is one of the only truly realistic hunting game out there. While you have to track your animals down really slowly and quietly it makes for a good game because you are constantly looking around trying to be careful while finding the correct tracks for your animal. The way the guns aim, and work make it harder but more fun.Although you have to pay to hunt in other locations and hunt different animals, it is still fun to hunt those damn White Tails. I can take from 20-200 minutes or even more to kill one animal... if you keep scaring it off which makes for great concentration and learning. This game has also improved my eye sight, believe it or not.even with the ""Pay 2 Win"" (Not really) more like ""Pay 2 Hunt more animals in different locations"" I would give this game a 8/10",1

2014,This game is probably the best Valve game I have played! So much fun and the custom maps are cool. Great game if you like to shoot zombies with some friends :),1
2014,"Epic game. New maps, weapons, melee moves and enemies. I recommend this game to everybody who likes old school FPS games or to people who are bored with the new ""realistic"" FPSs like CoD and BF. Only bad thing is that it is Egypt again but it's not the end of the world and they made it look good. Buy this game or the complete pack when it goes on a discount!!!",1

If you are a fan of zombies and TWD or just like zombies, good characters and a long and interesting story about a group of people trying to survive a zombie apocalyps than you must get this game NOUWW!!! Also season 2 is out and you should get this before you play that cause of the saves importing from season 1 to season 2.",1
2014,This is probably one of the best games of 2012 that I have played!!! Alot better then the 1st game because of the better story and much more better places you visit. Side quests are even better and funnier now! Lots of hours to be spend on this game as you need to level up your guy to be able to complete some of the harder story missions! Also there are lots of surprise moments in this game and the characters from the 1st game return aswell. I recommend this game to anyone who loves FPS games and also a long story that can be played with up to 4 player COOP!!! You must buy this game!,1
2014,"Ok so I have to say this is my favourite CoD game of all. The MP is really balanced and the only OP weapon I can find is the 870MCS. All of the guns are good and there isn't any underpowered gun. The story is IMO the best in the series and even though I haven't played Ghosts I think the story from that game isn't even close. Zombies return and are still the same old thing which isn't bad at all (if it isn't fresh, doesn't mean it's rotten). I recommend this game to anybody who likes FPSs and is a CoD fan who loved Black Ops 1 or generally any Treyarch game. Get it nouw!!! :D",1
2014,"Based on the book by Dmitry Glukhovsky and I have to say the games is a beast!!!Story is pretty good and very interesting following the concept of you destroying the so called ""Dark Ones"". Being a post nuclear disaster game you will be killing lots of mutants and encounter Communist enemys and even fight the 4th reich!!! The problems with the game are sadly bad PC optimizing and a somewhat weird and not so clear ending that makes you ask alot of questions about what just happened. Overall I would say Metro 2033 is a really good game if you ignore the optimizing and other little problems and I say it is a game worth buying... it is only 9,99€. Also the sequel for this game called Metro: Last Light is coming out this year on May 17 for people living in Europe and I can't wait for it!!!",1

2014,"Some think that Terraria is the ""2D Version of MInecraft"".In a way that may be true but the game has a lot more to it than just being 2D. There is a lot more adventure in Terraria although the map is limited. With the different mobs scattered throughout the biomes, it wil be a lot more challenging.BOSSES-There are many bosses that you can fight. As you become better at playing, the bosses also get harder to make it a continuous challenge.ITEMS-Items!!...That one of the greatest things about this game. There are so many Items! You can make so many things. So many Weapons with different attributes and you can choose which ones you want to fight with depending on your preference of combat.BLOCKS-If you're a builder, there's a variety of blocks and the blacks can also change their shape too. You can beuild a lot of  things, anything you want to.Overall, I believe that Terraria is a cool game to play. The gaming hours can total over few hundred hours.

2014,Nothing spells teamwork better than charging at an infected horde with a melee weapon in hand to save a friend who got barfed on by a Boomer while another teammate of yours flings a Molotov Cocktail in your general direction and the last guy plays SNIPER ELITE with a hunting rifle miles away from the main conflict.10/10,1

2014,"By far the best zombie game i've played in ages, just as good as Day Z or 7 days to die. This game is set in an open world and works like a real world zombie apocalypse if you die you dont respawn you just change characters and keep going. If you tell an NPC to acompany you and they die, they are dead and you will never get them back.The story is awesome with you starting off with 3 people and slowly building from there while trying to get out of the place. Every playthrough is different because you could die early and make it so those 3 friends die before finishing the game.Apart from that there are also 2 completely different DLC's that just add to the chaos making the zombies harder and changing the map so you don't have to keep looking at the same place over and over again. They also bring in different types of playing, 1 telling you to go loud with military guns and weapons and the other takes a more stealthy approach to the game.I have got this game on PC and Xbox and love it on both it is a definite must have.",0
2014,This game is not ready to be played. I can't get past the tutorial because the game mechanics are basically broken.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS BROKEN AND NOT READY TO BE PLAYEDIf you are interested wait until it hits beta before you even consider buying it.You are basically a cyborg that being hunted by other robots that are huntin you and all you have to do is survive. but it is really hard when you cant even jump with the broken mechanics.DO NOT BUY,0
2014,I think this is my favourite RPG ever.,1
2009,i highly reccomend borderlands 2 as i has a good jump in jump out co-op which makes it a good game for me as if you need some help in a quest or just want to play some borderlands with your friends and just being able to leave whenever you want. i also like the full controller support as if you were a console user you can still use a controller or use a keyboard like tradditional PC gamers. I also love the style of the game simplistic but elegant and uses the cartoon graphics to its advantage. i also love the gameplay so many missions to choose from with many side quests to keep you busy and also the open world to run round finding all different types of weapons and loot to help you in your quests. All over a wonderful game to play and waste hours with friends. I highly recommend it.,1
2014,Yall mother♥♥♥♥as need thief,1
2014,Grate and fun game to play!!,1
2014,spectacular game! but the down fall of the game is the new health systom where when you die your health is at the minimum not like DARK SOULS I and II where each time you die you loose little by little and then you use a humanity to regain it all back. but in this it has a default health set for when you go undead. another downfall is the servers are still ♥♥♥♥ and makes it hard to summon players. but over all the game is amazing to play!!,1
2014,"10/10Great game, with lots of blood and fun, there are so many mods to download and it's tons of fun. You can play from survival, missions to simple kill and run. Definitely recommend playing ;)",1
2014,"As a fan of DC comics this game presents its characters really well, espiacially the Joker. The combat is really free-flow, smooth and satisfying in every hit. The story would not impact you the same way games like Portal or HL-series do but it does leave memorable moments. It could really be summarized to ""Punch, save someone, Punch, win :D""I wished there was a arena mode or something that can let me punch people indefinitely, but the closest you get is the ranked challenges :IRecommended, gameplay is smooth, polished and well done.Recommended: 9/10",1

Once we played the game we realised that it is a great game (especially since it is free).

2011,This Game is Amazing!  Even though it's 8 years old it's graphics are still fine and this is probably a personnal thing but i found the Medieval setting way cooler then a Roman setting with the awesome knights just mowing down peasants.The one problem like all other Total War games is that there are a few ai bugs that can be annoying but over all this game is just awesome and my favourite in the franchise.,2

My two russian maid wives had cooked me the perfect breakfast, of 426 fried pancakes with a side of sugar coated blueberrys. I unhooked my prostetic, dysfunctional legs and equipped my 4x4 wheels. As I gracefuly mowed down the building, I finaly made it to my office. After eating an entire mcdonalds menu (including the building and staff) I had recieved an electronic transmission from a man named, Sir. Scott Cawthon. He had instructed these very detailed step's for me. Let FNaF 2 onto steam and it will plauge the whole nation, then I will give you 99.9% of all profits. It was a great deal!

I heard once that a game with hours and hours of gamplay is better then one with only 4 or 5 hours, but this is not true. Sometimes a story is told better in a few hours than a week. An awesome sound track and many loveable characters. There should be more games like this.Thomas Was Alone Awesome",2

2014,At first i thought this game was gonna be good. I was wrong.Its amazing! You get to play as a bat that is mutated by something to make him human! When you start getting powers you meet people that can help you kill other people that are trying to make Arkham City worser. Its also gooder than Origins and Arkham Asylum because I cant get passed the first level after the intro. Play this game and you will make your fingers happy.,2

I never get bored with the amount of customization and the various routes you are able to take on any given job. If you are a truck driver you will truly appreciate the realism this game has to offer. Even if you aren't a truck driver this game has something for everyone.

2014,"Christ... This game... This game....If there was ever a game that I recommend to people, this would be the one. Think of it as Mass Effect as combined with Game of Thrones.Story is fantastic, and is great at hooking you in using its backstory system, gameplay is a D&D/FFVII combination, giving it an rpg dice roll feel, and it overall is a very polished game.However, setting up DLC is not an easy task, and will have you fiddling around for a while trying to register everything. My recommendation? Get a bioware account and register the game and its DLC before you load it. Otherwise you will spend four or five hours trying to get it all set up and recognized. There are plenty of great guides to fixing bugs, and the community is rather helpful when it comes to solving issues.Game 9/10DLC Setup 4/10",1

2014,This is a really fun good game that is worth getting fot the price of it. A great feature is being able to connect your Xbox One controller or Play Station controller up to your PC and being able to use it to play this game.

2012,"A far better port than the previous two installments. They've actually given us some options this time around and its great to see that there was some effort put into it. The game has been running very smoothly at a consistent 60fps with max settings on my gtx 970 and I haven't had a single major fps drop or bug or really anything. The only thing I've had trouble with for this title is the key mapping, for whatever reason I just couldn't get it running optimally, mainly during battles but this was easily remedied by simply using a controller instead.Fantastic port, would recommend.",1

2014,It Nice game,1
2014,"Definitely one of my all time favourite games, don't pay attention to my short play time as i first had it on my ps3 and pretty much did everything there was to do in it and have recently bought it on steam, along with all the new dlc and addons. I'd first like to say that even though the game looks a bit cartoony and odd, as soon as I started playing I fell in love with the cartoon look and style of the game. There are hours upon hours of hilarious and engaging content with more exciting adventures to be had with each new dlc that 2k games releases. As you progress through the game you earn skill points which go towards your character's strengths and abilities that can be changed to suit the way you play the game. If you liked the original Borderlands you'll love this and even if you did not, BL2 has a heap of improvements.There are (now) 6 different protaganists to choose from which can create a whole new aspect to the game and completely changes the way you play the game. With a fulfilling main quest, and an almost endless amount of sidequests and minigames, Borderlands 2 will leave you begging for more time to play.",1
2014,"This game is just pure fun.So many things that you and your car can do, so many custom maps and cars, the music adds to the feel of the game and creates the chill atmosphere.Graphics are sweet as and the adventure mode level design is perfect.tl:dr 8/8 would bang.",1

2014,A good solid game. While it is still in Beta it is worth $10.00 and will probably go up in price with new updates. The only had sides I have found are its lack of maps. Most gamemodes have only a single map. Anyway it is a fun game and more content will be added.,0

2014,overall good game mabey is has been ported a little bad but hey look rockstar aint perfect :) also with windows 7 it works better and if you have intel you might have some problems such as broken models/textures but i mean your going to need a dedicated gpu anywase to run it the way they attended :) overall 10/10 the devs really stepped up their game the year of release and im proud of that if your looking for a game where you can run people over with them on your wind shield or let them hold onto your car door while you drive OR if you just love ragdolls and good physics you have found the right game :D so if you see anything i listed in this comment that you would like in a game i Suggest you buy this game :),1

2014,"This game is really great depending on what you enjoy. The game allows you to create a battle vehicle in your own image but holds its restrictions. It has a block/item cap which is good because people can build an insanley gigantic vehicle if they aren't a high enough level. The game offers many modes of transportation (hovering, driving, and flying) and all of which are very usfull. The tech tree includes some really cool items, such as a plasma canon or a railgun, but is fairly difficult to progress in. All in all this game is very enjoyable and I highly recomend it.",1
2014,ok for those who don't know garrys mod is a sandbox. a game where you can make anything and everything (apparetly) ok what about if im not that inventive. well we have steam workshop support. well whats on the workshop you may ask.well theys pretty much anything you can inmagine. ok well i want a giant flying naked woman.mmmmmm sorry don't have that. ok how bout a horse i can ride on. sorry don't have that either. fine how bout this map a server is running. sorry don't have that. so what else i can do. well theres multiplayer. ok? it hosts everysort of gametype you can think of. so i join a rp server and i find its filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥s breaking everyrule on the server from killing people to traping them and vehicles against walls and the admins are no where to be found. so i went stuff it and moved on to another rp server where it has a leveling system so i was in a stuation where im only level 3 when everyone else is level fifty billon or something just as bull ♥♥♥♥. so it ends up you emptying every single bullet in your gun and reserve and still not kill them yet you can't seam to take two rounds before dieing. the reason why leveling systems work in games say fallout its because its single player and the levels adjust for the diffculty. the reason why levels don't work with a multiplayer game such as gmod is because the maps are small and the low level players are stuck playing with high level scumbags and you end up in a situation where your trying to protect your home and you can't kill him because he has a health of one million(or something just as stupid) and you end up dieing to one or two hits so i went ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to it and i just played single player. it kept me busy for a bit but you end up with ♥♥♥♥ all to do. some might say im being to hard on it its just a ten doller game some might say im to hard to please and some of them can shut the ♥♥♥♥ up.,1
2013,"If you love space and sci-fi this game is a must have, exploration in this game is my favourite part as discovering rare planets and flying up close to them looks imensly cool.

2003,"Absolutely fantastic game. I could not stop playing and have played several hours of it within a couple of days. I love the crazy plot and the sidemissions are great fun as well as the story. This game is hilarious and I was laughing the whole way through. It is absolutely crazy with scenes ranging from Princess Kenny drinking green goo that turns her into a Nazi zombie to disguising as a doctor and giving Randy Marsh an abortion. I would recommend this game to everyone.The only thing that I didn't like when I was playing this game was when it ended. I enjoyed it so much and I wanted it to never end. I wish the game was longer. Overall, South Park: The Stick of Truth would have to be one of my favourite games. I was glued to my screen while I was playing it and I would definitely play it again and again. If you love South Park, get this game now. It does not disappoint.",1
2014,Great Tactical play,2
2014,"Having played the game briefly and read quite a few of the reviews, I felt like I needed to point out that the game, while under the badge of a Total War game, is not what hardcore fans would expect of a game under this title. This is not a negative thing, and I quite enjoyed playing the game, due to the simplicity of it. It is on a level of Clash of Clans or the like, and appeals more to the casual gamer, then to that of a hardcore Total War fan. I found it enjoyable to play, as I'm a huge fan of most games in a Medieval period.",2
2014,"This is probably one of the best Total War games on launch. I was able to get into the game fine (I've read about some people not being able to launch the game or getting a black screen, but it's expected that there would be some sort of bugs on launch). Optimisation is the best out of any game released by CA. I've got nearly all of the most recent games in my library, and it is definitely the best performing. The battles are awesome, magic animations look absolutely amazing and cavalry charges are the best I've ever seen. One of the most well polished triple A games I've seen for a very long time. Kudos to CA and well worth the wait!",2
2014,SUCH A FUN GAME!!!! Currently my favourite! Such a good platformer 10+++++/10,1
2014,"Planetside has a lot of problems, but there's one thing that it does better than anything else - warfare on a massive scale. In no other game can you expect to play with and against hundreds of players. In battlefield, the biggest size you can get is 32v32, a size which is exceeded on a daily basis on every server. If you want to see what it's like when you cram 150 people into an area less than 100m x 100m, you might as well download it. It's only 10gb. The worst thing that can happen is you don't like it. I've got 2 pieces of advice for you if you do decide to play:1. Join an outfit, even if it's some ♥♥♥♥ tier zergfit. You'll learn how to play more easily if you've got a group to follow. Post on /r/planetside if you want some advice as to outfits2. Look up wrel on youtube. He has a bunch of vids that are really useful to new players. You'll learn a lot of the secrets to the game off people like him. You will get farmed at first, but half the fun is the learning curve",1

2014,"This game is pretty okay. I played this game originally on the 3DS and when this game is going to be released on Steam, I was confused, but mostly excited. I played this game for countless of hours not due to the RPG or the battle mechanics, but rather the Visual Novel-esc gameplay with the Female characters. Learning about their backstory, struggles and quirks, it is a pretty interesting ride. However, the battle mechanics is what caused the game to be okay. The battle system does drag as it is repetitive and gets stale fast. It is interesting in concept such as the position of the characters and chaining but battles can be easily be won by using the auto command. I know this is a dungeon crawler type game but the aesthetics of the labyrinth looks unappealing and not that interesting. And yet, I still continue on playing. Because of wanting to know more of the characters and learn how they progress, I continue to slog through the labyrinth just to see what happens next with the characters. I know at points the characters have the personality of your typical anime but I am a sucker for romance and Conception II is no exception.Now to talk about the port. The port is pretty good. 60 fps, better visual graphics and the ability to change the voice between Japanese and English is a nice addition. Also all the DLCs, from what I read, will all be in the Steam edition pre-packed which is nice. Overall the port clearly have some effort put in and not just dump it from the 3DS or Vita version. Overall, I would say Conception II: Children of the Seven Stars is an okay game. If you were to treat this game more of a Visual Novel such as I did, you will have a much better time though be mindful of the repetitive battle system.",1

2014,"A good game, but it has pros and cons (like all games)ProsThe gameplay and strategy are really very good. Playing with friends is pure fun. The ships are interesting which give you the incentive to try and level up to get new starships.A very deep crafting system, but alot of the time you will find you sell swimming in money, as a lot of simple things you find or craft sell for alot. Some people will like this (including me, which is why i put it pros)ConsThe Storyline is a bit boring, you don't really listen to the dialogue since there is no voiceovers, which just leaves you like a henchman doing what everyone tells you to do not knowing what the outcome is.The missions are very repetitive, you really just go around scanning things in space, and that occasional ground mission or space fight, which, are not that bad.Overall, I would give this game a 7/10.Not a bad game at all.",0

It has thousands of weapons and grenade mods, that you can choose from as you get further into the game. This game is about 30 hours long to complete the story if you are just wondering around, searching every area for epic loot. Overall, this game is great to play with friends, and has HEAPS of EPIC LOOT in every area.",1

I died about 290 times in this game, and almost gave up on playing the game anymore, but all you have to do is continue trying again and again, until you finally defeat the Titan.

That being said it is also a far cry from something as simple as the classic clicker. If you are looking for a strategically competent if repetitive game with a lack of some of those awesome pronz from the first game you'll not be disappointed.Personally I like it, much of the Huniepop spirit is in this game (even the reused voices from the girls of the first game felt more nostalgic than budgeted). I hope the developers take the good from this game and expand upon it while recognising the short comings and working on them.Keep it up, i eagerly await the next installment!",1
2014,Great Game but please fix Multiplayer!!!! always getting kicked out because of sync it's annoying!!!,1
2014,"Such a great game to play of a night/day with friends, The game can be frustrating and it is difficult to stay stealthy but once you get the hang of the game you won't be able to stop playing and will most likely end up purchasing all the DLC's for about 15 bucks. Highly reccommended game!",1
2014,"Great Game, (If you like to get the absolute ♥♥♥♥ scared out of you), terrifying game with great graphics, some scenes are a little predictable but all in all it's one of the scariest games I've played yet.Would love to see a sequal!",1
2014,"Scary, Not as good as the first though",1
2017,An awesome take on a FPS. If you love a challenge it is a must have.,2
2017,"I've ♥♥♥♥ing had it with this game, I swear to god, if you don't die from flying off ladders while trying to climb down them, you randomly break your leg while standing still, and if that doesn't kill you, you will more then likely get mauled to death by zombies who either won't die, or continue to chase you through buidlings like they are nothing, and for the unfortunate ones, the zombies characters don't even load, so you have no idea where to hit to kill them.I know it's a Early Access Alpha, but come on, if you are gonna charge 30$ for it, at least fix the giant ♥♥♥♥ing holes in your game before even releasing it.For one minor example; I was recently waiting for the servers to come back online after they were taken down for a update, all good and well, servers come back up, I log on, time to head out and find more gear. Well no, I can't because for absolutely no logical reason, my leg breaks.Being the stubborn idiot I am, I decide to endlessly barrel-roll down the stairs, out the building and around the corner to some trees, I make a splint out of the wood I get from chopping the tree, seemingly getting better until I hear a zombie. {Panic face on} I sit there, crouched with my trusty axe in my hand ready to kill the incoming zombie! Waiting.......still waiting....., after a good 4 mins of sitting there looking in every direction around me, I decide the zombie isn't going to come after helpless me after all, especially when I can't see it anywhere. I start applying the splint and boom, there is the zombie, now making a nice meal out of my intestines simply because I could hear the zombie 5 minutes before I could see it.However, In my current anger, I would still recommend this game to anyone who wants so many bugs and glitches that you end up putting your fist straight through your monitor and into the pornography collection you have hidden behind it.*DayZ Crawl-alone Edition* Because at any given moment, your leg will break, making you crawl for 5 hours until you find the items needed to fix the ♥♥♥♥ing bone sticking out of your shin.",1

1998,"From Jeff Smith's graphic novel to a telltale game chapter in the TTG bible. The story is three bone cousins Fone Bone, Phoney Bone, and Smiley Bone get seperated from each other and Fone discovers a vally full of crazy creatures.

AN OLD TIMER IS HITTING THE STREET!!!Yeah I don't like the stick of truth, but no offence this game and episode 1 is WAY better than the stick of truth, The game macanics (Message me if i spelt it wrong) are the same from episode 1: Create you charater, Battle enemies and Watch you charater in 2D cutscenes, I give this game 10/10",1

2014,"I don't know what to write here... So here's a pancake recipe.Ingredients:100g plain flour2 eggs300ml semi-skimmed milk1 tbsp sunflower oil or vegetable, plus extra for fryingpinch salt1.Blending in the flour: Put the flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Crack the eggs into the middle, then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.2.Finishing the batter: Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream. Traditionally, people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins, to allow the starch in the flour to swell, but there’s no need.3.Getting the right thickness: Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into a jug, return the pan to the heat, then leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.4.Flipping pancakes: Hold the pan handle, ease a fish slice under the pancake, then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.",1

2014,"If you ever wanted to kill the world with... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? Well then this is the game for you. Choose your plague, evolve it, and watch as humanity gets destroyed and see how it tries to defend itself from their imminent death. Or you could do it the ""passive"" way and enslave them with a mind controlling worm, which is personally my favorite plague. Or if you're one of those zombie loving people, well we got the plague for you. There is a virus that brings the dead to life. You can decide if you want it to simply destroy humanity with sheer force, or if you want your zombies to become vampires and only drink their blood. You can even bring back the mummified dead. Humanity even nukes the places with zombies in them, United States might even nuke China, or the other way around. I simply recomment this game because it's so much fun to play. I might also add that there is going to be multiplayer and diseases from the past like the black death, smallpox and the swine virus. For those who own the mobile version, this is not some kind of scam. You notice that they put a lot of effort into the game and it even includes new things that the mobile version doesn't have. Thanks for reading and sorry for these ""spoilers."" Have a good day or night, or at whatever time you're reading this.",1

2014,"The game designers were very creative with their artworks. They are able to pull you in to the scene itself with such unique picturesque views. While playing it is fun to find all the secret snouts & memories.Sound effects & music is perfect. The storyline is good, but not too detailed. Unfortunately the character can be hard to controls due to all they keys blindings: especially during battle. But overall fantastic game.",1
2014,"The game was pretty, engaging & overall pleasant experience. I really like the cheeky, yet simple storyline, & exploring is a bunch of fun. My experience:Personally I love exploring, & I seemed to rush ahead from the story so when I went exploring I would find items or places specified for a chapter, & get confused with the items & places alot. They had a weird balance between being able to interact with some future chapter items, while some not at all, which didn't help me. When the eye icon showed up & I clicked it, for particular things it wouldn't say anything which to me defeats the purpose of putting an eye icon. Needs fixing: I had trouble at chapter 19 because the head statue I was meant to use didn't spawn in the right spot.Recommendations:Chores are great, I was able to get all the gifts in the first 2 chapters. Make sure to read the clues carefully, & look around the rooms to find all the items & hints u can find. If u are really stuck hold an item up that u expect to use, & it will give u a indicator to show u where to place it. Use ur abilities wisely & u will do great.",1

2014,"Alrighty, its a great game, love the challenges, characters, style, story & stamper is awesome...........................................................................................................................But Jesus is anyone else having trouble with the timing level 7. I've been stuck. Its fustrating. I am terrible with timing games. Plus it doesn't save ur progress. U gotta play all last 3 timing levels at once. Need more time or something..  theres a part in the first timing level where u have blocks & this guy is distroying them constantly. Or u have to get down the spiky wall down & u accidently hit like the first spike, so u have to watch ur character waste 8 seconds of u falling down this wall...Ughhhhhhggrgrggr raging alot sorry.. I really do like this game",1
2014,"I Love the voice over with the animation and style the game is presented in. The attitude of the game has moved towards a great strong new direction. Fair warning the game starts off slow, but the more you get playing the better. Especially when you start multiplayer mode. Basic good storyline, easy controls. -I might suggest adding a hand controller option though.The combat is natural, just don't leave your group behind, because you won't be able to handle it all on your own.I also enjoy the small touches like crafting and unique characters and enemies with there own individual skills.Overall I just want more, missions, enemies and maps.Thanks",1
2014,"Got this game as a puzzle lover, but I found that I got stuck in parts. Then I used a really helpfull guide that let me solve the harder puzzles with simple clues, & had black marker hidden answers for when you really needed it. Had an amazing time with a bit of help. I recommend it. A game of simple structure, with a beautiful view.",1

2014,Great game. Fighting mechanics are awsome but the missions are repetative. Variety weapons warframes and abillities or known as mods. Mod your weapons with upgrades and make your warframe stronger. Conclave (pvp match) is very fun to test your frames abillity against other players warframes. Choose your fight style: Go rush in as melee and hack every enemy up or try to be sneaky and take them from behind. Different types of missions such as Rescue Sabotage and Survival. Overall amazing game and one of my favourite F2P's.,1

2014,"An action-packed game that will certainly send chills through your spine at least once during the gameplay. If the main storyline wasn't horrifying enough for you, you can withness the events that happened prior to it in the Whistleblower DLC. The graphics in the game are excellent and the game is terrifying. However, the places to hide get repetitive as the game progresses because they look moreorless the same: lockers, under desks, etcetera.The encounters are filled with suspense and fear, although that fear becomes irritation and rage after a while. I believe this to be something that the game developers wanted. As time went by, you were just eager to leave the asylum and you began to play more recklessly and you felt like you knew the asylum, which is to your advantage. Overall, I think it's definitely worth playing because it was a very well built game. 9/10",1

2014,"this game is stupiditly fun. for all the clasification issues, removed items, internet hate, and bad reviews, there is a whole lot more love as well. a LOT MORE.first of all, the copycat problem. this game is NOT a copy of GTA in any way. can you explode aliens heads with rays in a simulated world in GTA? NO! thats because this game takes the average game, and SMOOSHES it down the drain.the game has infinite posabilities as well. do you feel like blowing up a group of dancing hot dogs using super fireballs? well, you can! you can do practicaly anything you want. it's that big.now here we are. no, in no way is this game worse because of the recycled city. think about this for a second. after sr2, imagine if volition recycled the city of stilwater AGAIN. sr3 would have been a dreadful hit. everyone would be hating on it because of the reused town. so, volition made a new city. and people hated them. but, imagine if volition had used the city for all the SR games. this game would have gotten nowhere sales-wise. i am glad that the steelport town was used again for this game. no joke.finally, are the superpowers worth the extra money? yes. they bring a whole new element of gameplay to an already existing genre. the endless hours of fun seen in other SR games are made better with these powers, because it allows more freedom, more quickly, and more gameplay, more smoothly.the story had been improved as well. instead of the silly sex jokes constintly used in the third game, this game uses well-written humor to its advantage. i grew attached to zinyak, the evil alien, due to his constant enjoyable cutscenes and speeches.this game improves over saints row the third in almost every aspect. the gameplay is smoother, the characters are more customisable (with a new feature that allows for change of pitch), the story is more involved, the humor is smart, and the game has so much to offer.so is it the best in the series? in my opinion, yes. before you storm me and destroy me, remember the order i have played the sr series in: SR3, SR4, SR2 (still finishing), and soon, SR. i am currently prefering it over SR2 because i find the missions and cutscenes a lot more exciting and open-eyed, with inclusion of licensed music and motion capture.this game is not only my favourite of the year, but has to be one of the best i have ever played, along the lines of the legend of zelda - majoras mask, and the elder scrolls V - skyrim.i give this title: 10/10",1
2014,"This game is really good. Tight controls, Fluid animation, Classic beat-em up gameplay, and a sweet vegas casino inspired soundtrack to listen to.

2002,"Pros:-Colourful and vibrant levels and environments-Lots of fun and unique weapons-Funny and interesting characters-Engaging story-Decent enemy varietyCons:-The drop rates leave a lot to be desired-Scaling, especially in UVHM, is bad, forcing you to look for gear every 2 levels-Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM) could have been handled better-Did I mention that drop rates sucked? I mean really sucks.Overall, I highly recommend playing BL2. It's a ton of fun and you will not regret the purchase.If possible get the GOTY edition which gives you the 4 major campaign DLCs, 2 new player characters (which are both awesome) and UVHM 1. And I highly recommend getting the Digistruct Peak DLC which bumps up the difficulty a lot (if you found UVHM to be too easy). While UVHM has its flaws, it is still fun once you get the hang of it.

2014,i really liked the look of this game i was looking forward to playing with friends but when we got in the combat was uninteresting the story didnt really pull you in i liked the graphics the art style was nice but you cant make an amazing game with just a good art style if you are thinking about buying this give divnity original sin a look first its probably more what you want,2
2014,game is really fun like xcom enemy unknown but with a heap of cool improvements example stealth and using it to set up ambushes to take out large groups of units the new units are nice ranger probably the best  some performance problems and encountered one but reloading fixed it and haven't seen anything since and bug I encountered will probably be fixed when they release a patch over all great game lots of fun new features that werent in last game are good and i am enjoying playing it instead of talking to people,2
2014,"First of i have played all the Ghost Recon titles and they all have an amazing tactical experience and I like how ubisoft has gone in and taken all the best tatctical elements from the games, mainly from future solider and implemeted them into a free 2 play  multiplayer game its truly amazing . if you ask me i would say this game is all about skill and has no pay 2 win elements in it sure if you want too dump money into it and get some pretty fat gear its your choice but you can unlock everything by simply playing the game and earning the in game currency, you could also just stick to the first tier weapons as they are really cometitive and have los of mod options to improve. this game is amazingly balanced and has little too no bugs. All the classes are balanced evenly and are fun, Weapos just have that amazingly crisp feel and look.Just pick it up your not loseing anything because its free.9.5/10pros - inspires teamwork- easy to lear cover system- encourages tactical gameplay-plenty of custimisation options- amazing graphics and gameplay-addicting-free!- Amazing matchmaking systemCons- terrible ping - not alot of servers in countries like australia- Needs more maps and game modes- needs to be a bit more optimised as im running a gtx 780 and still not getting 60 fps on high",1

2014,Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is one of the best games i have ever played. i has all sorts of maps from hill climbs to freefallers. the one thing that i dont like about it though is the tilting but thats just me. All that aside it is a really good game. 90/100,2

One thing i found a little bit anyoing was the fact that free roam had to be unlocked; its unlocked after you finish the story but still it would be nice.

2013,"Jogava Magic (físico) e amei o virtual. Ao meu ver falta algumas coisinhas básicas que por muito passa despercebidos. Bem, vamos lá:PRO: - Não é p2w (pay to win) como muitos falam. Como ""amante"" de Magic que sou afirmo-lhes: Apenas com o pacote básico (set do conjunto inicial) é possível vencer muitos decks do meta. Como o fiz, jogando com budget de Aura. - Muito melhor que os jogos anteriores, tem uma possibilidade, um acessibilidade maior ao que o Magic é. - Um iniciante não tem do que reclamar. É bem explicadinho.- É em português. - Deixarei que descubram os outros pros. =)CONT:- É complicado. Muitos amam cegamente o que foi feito, mas eu acho que o jogo poderia ser mais optimizado em um todo. - Apesar de ser acessível os boosters o preço faz com que você jogue sem parar. É possível, obviamente; porém, todavia e entretanto, gostaria que as RECOMPENSAS fosse ao menos... Um pouco mais elevadas. Magic foi, é, e sempre será um jogo que me traz felicidade e AMIZADE. Aconselho a que todos joguem, principalmente os iniciantes nesta versão. Espero ter ajudado!",2
2007,fun,2
2007,i just dont like the start of the game where everything is sos slow,2
2014,This game is a really good game that I think everyone should play some times it can be hard but the more you playe the better you get,1

2014,"Bueno, para hacer esta review voy a escribir un ""diario"" de  lo que fue la primera experiencia:Día 1 - Estaba en un avión con mi hijo (supongo) cuando de repente se escucharon unos ruidos raros y el avión se partió en 2, cuando desperté vi a una persona llevándose a mi hijo, creo que era un indio. Agarre todo lo que pude del avión y encontré un campamento, de lejos parecía que no había nadie pero cuando me acerque, habían un montón de cuerpos mutilados y quemados, camine hacia la costa y encontré otro campamento pero esta vez había un indio muerto. Leí mi guía de supervivencia y me las arregle para construir un refugio y una fogata.Día 2 - Me desperté y explore la zona un rato, encontré un palo que me sirvió para pescar. Decidí quedarme en la costa ya que tenía comida y el bosque me asustaba un poco de noche. Empecé a construir murallas de madera. Cuando estaba talando un árbol un grupo de indios se acercó, intente mantenerme lo más alejado de ellos y un rato después se fueron.Día 3 - Seguí talando árboles para las murallas, cuando otra vez se acercaron los indios. Esta vez eran más y uno de ellos me empezó a correr, corrí hacia una colina y ellos regresaron de donde vinieron.Día 4 - Termine de construir las murallas, me fui a explorar un poco el bosque pero de la nada salieron los indios otra vez, intente atacarlos pero ellos me ganaron, Me dejaron inconsciente.Día 5 - Desperté en una cueva. Estaba todo oscuro, prendí mi encendedor y empecé a caminar. Tenía miedo, a medida que avanzo empiezo a ver cabezas mutiladas en el piso, cada vez más y más, algo me ataca por la espalda, corrí por el camino sin mirar atrás, no tenía energía .Me dan el último golpe.Fin del ""diario""Este juego es increíble y eso que está en desarrollo ( Y QUE LO HICIERON 4 PERSONAS!)  - Gráficos: muy buenos. El agua, las sombras (hay uno o dos bugs con las sombras) La luz, las texturas, todo se ve bien eso si hay que arreglar un poco la introducción y los arboles cuando los talas.- Jugabilidad: muy buena, todo depende de vos, no hay tutorial solo 3 hojas de un libro que te dicen cómo hacer un fuego un refugio y como distinguir entre una baya venenosa y una normal. Tú ingenio sirve de mucho podes hacer molotov, hachas caseras, tenes que aprender todo por tu cuenta. Sobrevivir es la clave.- Controles: NO te los dice, ni en opciones ni en el librito, en un sentido me gusta porque tenes que aprenderlos vos pero en otro molesta porque si no le agarras la mano y queres saber algo o cambiarlos no podes.- Sonido: Muy buenos efectos, de noche se escuchan hojas crujir lo que le da un ambiente de miedo, no hay delay excepto en la introducción ahí hay que arreglar mucho, como poner pasajeros en el avión (vas vos solo  tu hijo) el ruido cuando se rompe, y la caída tiene que sonar más fuerte.Mi puntaje: No puedo puntuar este juego ya que esta en desarrollo pero lo recomiendo para la gente que quiere algo nuevo, interesante y divertido. De un segundo a otro podes pasar de cortar árboles a estar rodeado de cuerpos mutilados, este juego da miedo al principio pero cuando conoces a los enemigos y que puede pasar ya no da tanto miedo, lo bueno es que el miedo es constante por que no sabes que puede pasar. Gracias por leer. Esta es mi primera review así que si ves algún error o algo que no te gusta coméntamelo y lo voy a arreglar.",1

System reqirements are really low as well so you don't need a 980 GTX ti to enjoy the graphics because they look great on the lower end of graphics cards anyway.The only thing I would like in the game is when planets collided it would be awesome if you could slow it down and watch them form into a super planet. Because at them moment the planets don't grow any bigger if you smash them together and one of them kind of vanishes and all you can see if a bright light, if you look at it close up. But that might require a super computer and then they would be false advertising ;). Other than that I think it is perfect.",2

2014,"I'll start by saying that Boo Bunny Plague is a fantastic game, worth the price and worthy of a sequel.Where this game shines is in it's character. The best way to describe this game is that it feels like Metalocapyse, Aqua Teen Hunger Force and the Brak show put together. It combines great music, funny dialouge and an interesting world. At no point does it feel like your playing a game but rather experiencing a story worthy of a primetime slot on Adult Swim.In keeping with that comparison this game does not at any point feel like it has a high production cost, not saying that it didn't cost the develouper a lot to make it. The game mechanics are also not very innovative and the art is stylized but not detailed to the degree some people may be used to. However for a game like this I think none of that matters. It has all the mechanics needed to keep a player engauged and help tell the story, not to mention the game genuenly feels challenging on normal.Play this game if you want to experience a fun story with memorable characters and I guarantee you will want a sequel by the end. It's also worth getting the delux version before or after playing, with extra delux! So much deluxing...",1

Highly recommended and hoping to be out As soon as possible. For those comments saying who dont reccomend the game might have a few bugs and fixes here and there I just hope the movement of the game would be a good one cus the efforts are worthwhile after right? the fact is that you guys give all the possibilities there are in a free to play game are just awesome. All it needs are a good crew to help develope and a good attitude avoiding haters and focusing on the these mistake people will give here and there hence all in all a good worth to download free to play game""",1
2014,If u are one with the people who actually love hardwork paying off this does realy pay off. though I never played the 1st game I think this game is infuses me like drugs (not that I use those) Just make sure for people to know that there are doing and what they know is shown on the level of the player I mean how can this game get any better?,1
2014,"Hey there game devs and reviewers alike I would just like to thanks some of the people who actually put a great amount of effort to this game and just hoping that we would see this game strive:My thoughts are:I would Recommend this game for the rts users with an average grade of 7.5/10. I know what your thinking this number seems to be about lets say a moderate to low grade but for a game with potential I would give a try to buy it but, all these stuff you need to buy are just not worth that extra money. We paid 16-25 dollars for these last years in steam in a game with in game purchases honestly I would pass. Im not saying your game is bad but your game has the potential for a 16-25 dollar game in steam we just need the in game purchases to be cheaper or even better dissapear. Sadly games like these are most likely to dissapear from us yet cease to find those GOOD moments in these games. I just wish people's thoughts on this game would actually be changed cus once a game is nice towards them it would be ongoing. unlike those games where we dont actually look inside that light in their comments. All in all this game is in a  gamble decision whether to continue these in game purchases and bugs but please remember the price is in the quality of the game we actually buy I hope you game devs find it in your heart that these games should be  relativlty worth its price. Who knows these game devs look up to comments like this and in the future these people have the mids touch (dota preference) Thank you whomever reads this review and have a nice day""",1

1994,"Portal 2, one of the best puzzle games out there. The game revolves around not just tests but chell and the other characters such as, Wheately, GLaDOs and of course Doug Ratman. In the start of the game you awake in a strange room, being told that you are in suspension you go back to sleep. then rudely woken up to the sound of someone knocking on the door. And this is where you meet Wheately, a brittish accented core with a bit of an attitude towards you. but enough ofn the start of the game, lets focus on the gameplay. The gameplay is simple shoot either a blue or orange portal on a white surface and not a black one. but when you get further into the game it gets dark toned really quickly, but i will let you find that out. All in all Portal 2 is a great game if your into your puzzles, it even has Co-op and in didnt even talk about the community maps. There are literally hundreds of them and still counting, if your into a good story, Co-op and puzzles. Then your going to love this game. 9.5-10",1
1993,"A mod turned full game.You play as Stanley. A.K.A Employee 427. His job is to push buttons on a keyboard. yeah imagine that for a job. but he discovers that there is no one there, and so the journey begins with a nutty narrator, telling you what to do. but you dont have to listen to him. Say if theres two doors, Narrator says left. but you go right. This game is just a fun little distraction and is worth the money you spend. Amusing and sometimes down right quirky its worth your time and money. 8-10",1

This new 2D take on the MOBA genre is generally a great game, and, while the matchmaking could use some work, the devs are constantly improving the game (They have promised to improve the matchmaking, so hopeat issue is soon resolved)I hope this review convinced you to buy the game! The devs definitely deserve it!",1

2014,"When I got this game, it looked as though it would be very fun, but as I started playing it, I found that it was quite boring, and the gameplay consisted of clicking people so they didn't die. At $20.00 I thought that this was a riduculous price for the game, which in all honesty, should really be a tablet game, the way you play it is just not good for a PC.",0

I strongly reccomend it, if you're unsure, you should try one the initial flash games before deciding.",0

It's got a racing storyline, with some open-world elements to allow you to explore the beautiful islands of Hawaii (no, not Kawaii) and later on in the game (spoiler)  Ibiza . It's a console port that's mostly well done but needs some peformance tweaks.

2014,"This game in the first 30 minutes of playing was amazing. I only got a short time to play it due to IRL issues but this was still probably one of the best TPS shooters i've played in a very very long time. Reason being all classes are balanced from the word GO! in TDM I didn't die too often enough for me to leave and not play it for another 2 hours but I was really enjoying it at the time. The downside of the game was the sword. It's OP from the begining as soon as you get the 3rd upgrade if I was the maker or the main editor of this game I would either A. Remove the swords, B Do a HUGE nerf for them or C just allow some servers to have them and others not. In replacement for what? I don't know but overal I think this game gives a pure TPS experience overal thank you for releasing this and I look forward to playing it more in the future.",1

2014,"Great Game with an epic campaign a bit short but well worth it definitely recommend for people who love action\adventure games and also has a bit of problem\puzzle solving, story line ends kind of suddenly but is picked up in Tomb Raider: Underworld, if u like this game i also recommend getting the rest of the trilogy (Tomb Raider: Anniversary, and Tomb Raider: Underworld)",1
2014,Great Action adventure game which is based around when lara was young this story is what makes her the hard core survivalist we see in the other games and movies.after getting through half the campaign you start to wonder how much more she can take and how long has the game got to end but after an amount of gameplay time and concentration you will gather the whole story which is quite interesting after 13 hours played i am at about 75% of the way through although i keep going back and gaining every collectible i definatly recommend buying this as it is a great game with an awesome storyline,1
2008,"This is a great game theres lots to do u can mess around with the main campaign for a while and if u need a rest you can go on 1 of many side missions/time trials-etc.Great part of this game is thers no class lock, at the start of the game u get to choose between 4 or so classes after which u will get your guns for that class in the tutorial but as soon as thats ended you can find and use any weapon from any class and use it as much as u want.you can even equip 2 of the same weapon as primary and secondarythis is an online mmorpg but if your worried about geeting somewhere in the game only to be killed but another player dont worry PVP in this game isnt forced you can interact and team up with other players other wise if u want PVP you can approach some1 and have a duel or you cango find a siege which makes players battle it out in TDM styled gameplay - but all PVP is opt-in onlyFor $10 this game is well worth it",1

2014,"Possibly one of the greatest games of the generation and the only game I won't ever regret pumping nearly THREE YEARS into.      The engaging combat system, reminisent to Ocarina of Time, is satisfying, brutal and not without its problems. Some of these problems include cheesing PvP with the use of backstabs and many of the deeper nuances not explained by the game at all. The game also boasts a subtle yet epic story, using item descriptions and character dialoge as the only sorces. However this is not a bad thing as it compels you to be more active and thaughtful in and out of the game. To this day, all I can do with my friends is argue about things like the godess Velka and the chronology and the events, the game's predicesors and the upcoming sequel. The game also has a very large and active community as people argue about lore, hold PvP turnaments etc. It is also exceedingly emersive with briliant voice acting, gorgeous sound assets and a musical score that will leave you in awe, make you cry and make you ♥♥♥♥ yourself all at the same time. However before purchasing this masterpiece, you must be aware of the plathera of problems it holds. Some of these are low texture quality, low screen resolution, 30fps lock, almost unusable with a keyboard and mouse, extreme frame drops and a staggering amount of bugs. However ALL of these problems can be fixed with the multitude of mods available for PC. Praise the Sun!",1
2010,"I would like to start this review with a disclaimer. This is one of the best shooters I've played in a VERY long time. I couldn't name for you the last time I had this much fun with a shooter. The gun-play is crisp and responsive, the level design is beautiful and intelligent and the refreshing return of objective based and team-play oriented combat gives every action you perform and kill you execute out feel meaningful to the overall outcome of the game. However...I cannot recommend this game in it's current form. This is almost entirely due to the business model of the game, for those unaware of it who don't want a long winded explanation I shall attempt to keep it brief. So you have 2 main aspects to the game's business model, cards/crates and mercs. The mercs are on a weekly rotation of 3 and week as of writing this review (this is already too little to have on rotation). The mercs all have differing play styles and unique personality however I believe that individual mercs are FAR too expensive. they can to anywhere from $10 to $15 at one point which is almost as much as you would have paid to get into the closed beta testing! The other aspect being the cards/cases is also rather unfair. Each case contains a guaranteed card and costs 1,000 in-game cash. This is already pretty expensive. The credits are quite hard to earn and the cases will almost never yield a worthwhile card. Something is to be said for the unavailability of credits as a real-money purchase (as of writing this review) but I would bet my bottom dollar that this is only temporary. It is also extremely expensive to trade up merc cards both in lower tier cards and in credits, making it an in-viable option by certain points in the game.  Now I love Splash Damage and I believe they are an extremely tallented developer who put their hearts into projects. I loved Enemy Territory to bits, I thought Brink was an extremely underrated game and I found the Batman: Arkham Origins multiplier rather enjoyable (if a bit rushed) however consumers can not excuse a game of unfair business models with the defense of its game-play. The saddest thing about this is that I do not believe this is entirely Splash Damage's fault. Instead I point a hesitant finger at Nexon, the publishers of the title. Do not forget, readers, that they might have a larger hand in this issue than you might think. So in summary? Fix your business model, then we'll talk.",1
2014,"Good game, gets repetetive when you put some hours into it but good for item trading like Spiral Knights Crowns for TF2 items.",2

2014,"DO YOU LIKE SIMPLE, EASY TO LEARN GAMES? WELLthis game probably isn't for you unless you're into learning alot of sh*t in the game.Machinecraft looks nice and IS nice but in the first hour of playing you will go ""WHY WON'T THIS WORK?!?!?"" then you play for another few hourse then go ""HOW DO I MAKE THIS WORK!?!!?"" then you hit the 10-hour mark. After 10 hrs of playing you can now make simple machines like a car, after 50 hrs you make your first plane, after a few 100 failed attempts on how to make and fly one ofcourse. Then the 100-hr mark and you can now make comples stuff but theyre not so polished, then the 200-hr mark (which I have currently), you make your first *insert a unique type of machine here*, after that you now realise that you could've done something with your life with the 200 hours you spent in the game. The game is proud of you, you, your friends, your family not so much.",2
2014,this is really fun!!!!!!!!!!,2
2014,"Great fun once you learnt how to play. Definitely recommend it for its price, especially when on sale.",2
2014,Very fast paced. The game starts to open up and is very enjoyable after the steep learning curve.,2
2014,"Fairly well optimised. Good port for pc, singleplayer is ok for passing some time though the strike force missions are terrible. Multiplayer does not have many players, incredibly difficult to find a match which is not team deathmatch which is more of the same if you have played the multiplayer of the previous Call of Duties. Zombies is great fun but just about nobody playing around the Australian area. If you really enjoy Call of Duty games and have enjoyed the last couple of them then this game is mostly a better purchase than CoD Ghosts but if you are sceptical about this purchase then there are many other games which would be a better purchase.",2

2014,"Kingdoms of Amalur: The Reckoning, is a very vibrant, detailed, and content-filled action-RPG. Although a few primative features make it frustrating at times, such as no auto-save functio, this is a very satisfying open-world fantasy experience that will keep you playing. Each side quest somehow feels intertwinned to the main story, which is great because it never feels like it's wasting your time. The upgrading system is quite excellent, although it is possible to become over-powered very quickly, if you choose to focus on one skill set, e.g Might, where you can hack a troll to death in a few swings. The combat is satisfying. Not too fast or too slow, and in most cases you can't just button mash. You must use a variety of weapons, magic and techniques to overwhelm your foe. And that's why I purchased this game, for a satisfying and rewarding hack and slash experience.",1
2014,"First of all... 10/10. I have never played a game that has made me /feel/ as much as Telltale's The Walking Dead. It is often iterated in many reviews, but each decision REALLY matters. Not only for the consequences for your choices, but for the emotions you'll feel. Whether that be sheer joy, relief, hate, or regret. And regret is really what makes this game so enthralling, you can actually make a decision in a video game you'll regret. You'll often think to yourself, ""(this character) didn't have to go through this or didn't have to die if I just made this decision differently"". I promise you, you'll never put the game down once you begin.UPDATE: The ending made me cry like a baby.",1

2014,"I never thought this game would spark my interest but damn, it definitely did and I love everything about it!",1
2014,"I was really keen on playing this game, I couldn't wait to give it a go! It has a really unique atmospher to it, the story and character designs are beautiful and the part I love most is how it also educates you with Alaska Native stories, which relate to what part you're playing in Never Alone, the more you progress through it, the more interesting cultural insights you unlock! You don't see much games like this, which is why it's pretty sweet to play something different.But unfortunately, to me, it has more negatives than positives such as having unresponsive controls, which is absolutely frustrating to deal with since you have to switch between two different characters fairly quickly at most parts. When one of them has been attacked, you instantly die - it'd be nice if you had a chance to at least get back up and try again instead of just dying and going straight to the last checkpoint (this annoys me a lot mostly because having pretty unresponsive controls and constantly dying in one hit tends to result in repeating that certain part a few times). Controlling the Bola can be difficult because it doesn't aim properly most of the time, you have to click the right spot for it to not bug up the aim; speaking of bugging up the aim, there's a fair amount of bugs in this game that definitely need to be fixed, the game bugged a few times for me when I jumped onto the ground or onto a wall then suddenly died or became glitched in a spot (using the Artic Fox, unsure about Nuna though).Probably playing local co-op would be best.(Sorry if I didn't word this review properly, it was hard to put in words)",1

2014,"PEWPEWPEWSpace-based-RTS. you build up your planets, you build up your fleet, and then there are a few big engagements and then you win. There are enough different methods you can use to get there, earlygame strats mostly revolve around either getting a fast fleet out to harass enemies or expanding as fast as possible to secore more income. Midgame is where all the big fleet engagements start, with fleets of around 30 ships on each side. balancing production with research and your spead of culture is  difficult, as lagging behind in any one of these will make the lategame painful. Finally, you have the massive engagements. a few hundred ships, 3 or 4 will die in the initial volleys. you can't lose a fight or else all your planets will be bombarded and you will die.I like this game.",1

2011,"I have spent countless of hours on this game and it was so much fun, joing a party with mates and smashing zombies heads in with frying pans. It really is something uniqie, it hasn't got a direction, you just play how you want and make your own fun. eg. in a sesh with some friends and you see a witch.....shouldn't shoot it....but you do, this is what makes this game awesome.But the visuals are rather medicore and should have been so much better at the time of its release.

2014,"Now before I start, yes, I have only played 6.8 hours on THIS VERSION! I have two accounts on two seperate PCs and my other account has the original dark souls 2. I'm basing this review on changes only as I would automatically recomend it if you are into this kinda thing. The new enemy placements are fantastic but not perfect, it makes the game 30% harder to get into, especially for newcomers to the series. Some enemys are in their respected areas unlike the original version except one thing.........that first boss you encounter.....pops up randomly throughout the game if you are part of the ""Company Of Champions"" and messes you up. Does this hurt the game? NO. This ultimately gives this title some exra difficulty and stress the first game (dark souls) was renound for. There are plenty of these kinds of changes as well as item placement which makes (what would have been common) items much rarer than you would expect. This really is the Company Of Champions/ New Game ++ version of the original dark souls 2 and if you have some extra pocket money....make the incestment!",1

Another outstanding fact about this game is how much it makes you question what sort of person you are, will you do your duty to your country and do as they request?

2014,"Endless replayability, with original concepts. Decent story if you thoroughly think it through and an excellent soundtrack to go with it. Hard for beginners but it's more addictive than doing a line of cocaine. Not that I would know. Would really recommend buying this game. It's perfect, considering this is an indie game, so it's really well made. Buy it whenever it gos on sale, but if you really want it, 6 dollars is still a steal. It's a great game for people with enough time for this game, but not enough for hardcore games like Dota. You can easily waste an hour on this game.The controls are great for anybody with mechanical keyboards, but rubber domes might be harder because you need to bottom out a key for it to register, taking more time/energy. Still easy to control though, just recommended to use a mechanical keyboard if you play many other games/ type a lot, as well. Play it with the music at its max, you will never regret it.The DLC is actually well developed and introduces lots of changes, making existing bosses and enemies harder. I would recommend at least reaching Mom thrice  before buying Wrath of the Lamb, as you get the vanilla, original hardcore experience before moving onto harder stuff. Overall, this game is great, one of the best indie games I've had the pleasure of playing. This is great as sadly, most of the time, I just go back to playing dota. Binding of Isaac is one of the few games I have in my library that I visit quite regularly. Buy this game if you have more self control than I do and don't have problems with other games.If you still aren't convinced, think of it this way: you get to shoot sp00ky monsters with your own tears. While naked. And you take pills that don't run your life. If you hate flies, this is the game for you. Also, it's sp000py.",2

2009,"Rust, well I could go on and write an essay on why you should buy this game but just to give a few poinbt and keep it short i would like so share ssome of my experieences and thoughts. My first 3 hours or so i was lucky enough to be left alone with no contact with any other players, I learnt how to craft and build my first shack where i made a campfire and hid inside of till daylight. I was playing with one of my friends and we found each other after about those 3 hours, I learnt the basics of the game within that time and managed to make a starting weapon and go on to hunting.Ok rust has issues and bugs here and there, but although it is only in alpha it is one of the best games i have played, on my second realtime day of playing rust i made 2 new friends and next thing you know we all built together hunted together and ofcorse raided less fortunate players together.My most memorable moment is when me and this group of mine we all sprinting through the pitch black night, armed to the teeth with weapons, armor and explosives, all you could see were our lazer pointers and flashlight atatchments, we arrived at a base 5x the sive of ours and with many c4 explosives we broke through and found the mother of all loot, we killed the people that were asleep and destroyed their sleeping bags, Harsh? we know, but after playing rust for a couple hours u will relise its survival of the fittest.Overall 20$ for a game that is only in alpha stage and has so much potential??? i think so, u would be insane to pass this offer.",1

2014,Dayz is awesome game don't get me wrong.But 80% of the people that play it are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.There are no real glitchs or game breaking bugs that I have seen so far.I would however like to see some sort of karma system put in place that stops or atleast makes people think twice about killing people just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.,2
2007,The only game where a play through cannot ruin the impact of its morbid but stellar storyline.-Shot two portals on different walls-Insulted by GLaDOS for what seemed like eternity-Shot to near death by turrets-Fell thousands of feet underground-Almost drowned-Discovered eerie drawings on the wall-Found my freedom11/10 -Would be imprisoned in Aperture Science again :),1

2014,"Skyrim is insane, its still playanle even 3 years after its release, its a must have game, DLC-HEARTHFIREi honestky thought this would be horibble, but then i got it on sale and it actually adds a good bit more to the game, something to do. If you play skyrim for simulation, then you should get this.Make a house, get hitched, adopt some kids and make them do chores, what better than that?Probably a 8/10DLC-DAWNGUARDAwesome. the dawnguard dlc is incredible, it adds planty of content and a great story line which can go one of 2 ways, Be a VampireKill all Vampires.both sides are awesome fun. DLC 10/10",1
2013,"Not good. I went into this game thinking it to be good, well, i was VERY wrong. The combat is horrible and theres no servers with good connection. There were some good ideas in this game, like the visor toggle and the emblem customiser, but they're 2 little goods in a game with so many bads.Wasted my time and money on this one.1/10",1
2013,"I bought this game to play with friends, then not being able to (because we couldnt make a sever) i continued to playing single player. after a few hours, i was hooked. Its great.GOOD:-Fun for single and multiplayer-Easy to get used to-Quite the challenge at times.Knowing that theres so much more to come (such as ship creativity, more races, more bosses, more crafting) i cant really write a bad part of the review, anything i would of said will be in the game soon(hopefully) anyway.DEFINATELY a game worth the price.10/10 for an early access.",1
2014,"I saw a 45 second clip of this game, and i knew it was something to look out for, i eventually found the game on steam and bought it instantly. Its great, heaaaps of fun.GOOD:-Plenty of experimentations for you to try,-Putting a picture of your choice on everything is sick (i chose seth rogan)-Quite detailed impact system.Bad:because the game is early access it has limitations that will hopefully be fixed. -on highway levels the AI cars are quite buggy/glitchy.-Some restrictions, such as path choice or obstacle placement.All in al its a fun game, worth the $7 (6.99) but i would like to see some blood textures and a bail function.9/10",1
2013,this game is very handsome,1

2014,"The game is very fun, with great gameplay, a interesting story and you do feel like a ancient powerful warrior striking down his foes. Plus it's a four player co-op game which makes it even more enjoyable.",2
2014,"This game is really cheap for such a good game , it looks random with what you can do , but some things you can do are awesome or hillarious , to making your own custom car using tables and making a train into a shuttle. I really recommend you get this game , its $5 , how cheap is that !",1
2014,"So here we are, in the second year of DayZ Standalone's release. So has it improved from its first launch back in December of 2013, will lets find out.So to start off, this game has not been optimized for the PC still, and even though they told us they will fix this issue once they have done everything else, it should be one of there top prioritys. It's not enjoyable to be walking around and out of no where you get single frames. But thats not to say the game has'nt improved, it has, for example one of DayZ's big issues last year was the horrible zombie A.I system, but it has been improved to the point where you can actually sneak past them, with out them noticing you from a mile away. This improves your gaming experience so much, because it adds a sense of realism to it. They have also included a huge new feature, which makes it so much easier to traverse around the world. It is the implementation of vehicles. The DayZ community was furious when there were no vehicles in its first launch, but when they did release it, they were much appreciative of them. They have also implemented many other things, i could go on for hours, but needless to say the game has improved and you can see they are working hard.So is it worth its price tag, NO, not yet that is, i would wait until they have fully released it, or if you want to support them you can do that as you wish.(NOT FULL VERDICT) 8/10",1
2011,"So , The ARMA Series is back at it again with ARMA III , so heres the question , is it worth your time and money????? Lets start off with the graphics , THEY ARE AMAZING , it is a definite improvment from later ARMA'S , and the true beauty is shown when you enter the endless forests and grass lands. The gameplay is will , lets just say , if you have played later ARMA'S and Dayz Mod/Standalone , then thats the kind of gameplay you will get , and they really have'nt changed much in that , they have kept there masses of amounts of buttons that do all little things in the game. The story , will if i  am honest , i really was never in to ARMA'S storys , but in ARMA III they have really tried to intrigue us , and kind of grapple us into there story , they want us to feel what it would feel like to be in the war , and i truly think they nail that. Now for the most reasons people buy the ARMA games , the mods , there is a whole variety of them , such as ALTIS Life , Epoch Mod , King Of The Hill , and so many more , so if u finish or are not enjoying the campaign , then just head on over and join into thousands of servers , with up to 80 players on each , trust me , you will never get bored.So , Graphics are terrific , Gameplay is spot on , Mods are Enjoyable , Campagn is good , i think we have a masterpeice , so no , this is not a waste of your money , and will , you will get your moneys worth.10/10",1
2014,"This was my reaction when i first played this game , ""OH MY ♥♥♥♥ING GOD"" , LEGIT thats what i said. Let me just say when you first step foot into this game you are already having a blast , the Prologue could of been shorter but it was enjoyable. half of the hours i have played was co-op with my mates , we just ran around and leveled up our agility mostly , and it was is endless fun, the story isnt anything special though , its short , easy , and forgetable in my opinion, if it were more slowed down, i guess i would have enjoyed it but it just was to quick , but thats not what its about , its about freerunning the main feature in this game , it so fluint , u could spend hours just running around and leveling up your player.This game , well lets just say , if i can run around for 2 hours without doing anything , no missions nothing , and still have fun , its a brilliant game ,and if you think about it not many games can do that. now if you think GTA 5 is open world wait until you get a load of this , you can climb anything you see , you can break anything you see , and you can nearly get into all the buildings , it is open world , TOOO THE MAX , so i truely think this game deserves game of the year , but its not up to me , so why dont you find out for yourself!!!!!!!!!!!!10/10",1

2014,"A bland and boring ""game"" made by an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ called Phil Fish (Look him up)It looks good, but good graphics isn't a substitute for bad gameplay.The puzzles and worlds are overly simple to solve/navigate and the only mechanic gets boring to use after an hour.Don't trust all the big review sites like IGN and don't spend money on this boring ""experience"", buy a dvd on paint drying in slow motion(More interesting than FEZ will ever be) it's not worth buying this game for the full price or discounted in steam sales.",2

2014,"At the time of writing this review I just finished the game about 30 minutes ago. Now, when I finished it, I felt amazing, and this game makes you feel amazing, both with its story (which I won't spoil) and gameplay. But, I finished it in 14 hours, which I didn't have that much a problem with exept for the fact that I finished dust:an elysian tale the day before in also 14 hours, and that was made by 1 person, which got me thinking, thinking about why there's such a similarity between game completion rate and such a big difference between development. However, this greatly redeemed itself when at the end of the credits it said that I completed 2% of it's entirety. Now, the gameplay is very good, from perfect platforming (alliteration!) to a well made third-person shooter, this game trully makes you feel like a badass and at times a genius when you finish a puzzle from a tomb. The only problem I had with the gameplay was the QTEs (quick time events) which got repetitive at times and made me die too many times. Another problem I had was the community for the multiplayer, the problem? It didn't exist, no-one plays multiplayer so I cant really talk about it much. to conclude, Tomb Raider is an amazing single player game with the problem of annoying QTEs and a non-existant multiplayer community, I recommend it for the single player, not the multiplayer.",1
2014,"I weep for all the people who were mislead in trailers. of all the games people could have gotten on steam, they were unlucky enough to buy this trainwreck, don not buy at all costs!",1
2014,"Heros and Generals is a really good game for anyone that is intersted in the war or fps games.The only downside is that most players will end up joining the Germans side making it a lot harder to find games. Good textures and sound effects, but has a few bugs and kinks but ither than that its a pretty good game.8/10",2

Not the case, there is no resolution that fits my computer, everything is still blurry even though I adjusted my settings to high and didn't move for 5 min and I was shot dead. This game is utter trash, before buying this game I thought ""I'll experience the game myself"". Don't. Listen to these people and do not buy this ♥♥♥♥ game, I would like a refund.",1
2014,"This game is awesome, Nice graphics. It's one of the best stealth action games I have played. You can complete a mission in many different ways, choose different paths to get to your objective.There's also magics like slow time , blink  etc which will help you alot. Great game overall 9/10",1

2014,"By far the worst CoD so far. This game is a huge dissapointment, I was banned for using a programme to change your FOV because at the time the game didn't even have an option to change the FOV. So after I get it they say it is allowed to be used and for awhile the game was playable. But then they changed there minds and said that the FOV changer was now banned and the only way you would have known that is if you followed them on twitter! The games has the worst optimization ever, it is basically a console port and stutters all over the place. 70% of the people that play are hackers so almost every game you get into there will most likely a hacker in it.

After playing this with one of my friends, I have to say that this is an extremely fun platforming game, that is both relaxing and difficult.Things I loved about the game:- Visual Quality (it is so smooth and the particles effects are awesome).- Puzzles (The start of the game was quite easy, but once you played through, the puzzles took me a while to think of what to do).- Using momentum to beat puzzles (it's so satisfying).Problems I had with the game:- A little bit laggy when playing with a friend (that might just be my internet, although other games are fine when I play them).- Voice chat in game is a 2 second delay (but you will probably use Skype, Tamspeak etc. anyway).I would give this a solid 9/10. Definitely recommend it to anyone!",1

2011,"Not really that interesting honestly, the visual style is kind of meh although that might be because of age, the gameplay is simple and isn't really used in very interesting ways, it overall just really gives the same vibe as overly simplistic mobile games, if you're not the sort of person to get into games like Angry Birds then I wouldn't get this game",1
2012,"Short but oh so sweet, Portal is an all time classic that I probably don't even need to bother reviewing at all really, immensely satisfying to play, look at, listen to and be insulted by, highly recommend",1
2011,"Visually stunning and interesting of course, but that can only carry a game so far, exploring becomes tedious and dull after a while as the puzzles don't really evolve much beyond the flipping perspective mechanic and the areas are connected in a confusing mazelike fashion that just left me feeling unsure of where to go and not really motivated to bother methodically searching around, maybe this just isn't my sort of game but I can't recommend it",1
2014,"The single player is short but very fun, manages to pack in quite an interesting story for such a compact game too, and the game itself plays really well, lots of tight stealthy action, with a suave visual/audio style and plenty of freedom to decide how you go about solving each level, plus a level editor to keep you coming back for even more",1
2012,"Very satisfying roguelike (or lite or whatever) platformer that will keep your children coming back for more, controls are tight and customizable to fit your preferred playstyle, exploring the castle, fighting enemies and searching for treasure is constantly addictive even after you've died and died and died again, and the music is kickass, highly recommend",1
2013,"Very difficult, but satisfyingly so, if I game gets too frustrating I usually just give up but this game sucks you in like quicksand, the more you try to leave the harder it becomes to do so as you get desperate to do better then you did before, controls are flawless, visuals are pleasing, the music is amazingly well done and fittingly atmospheric and you can chose whether the damsels you rescue are a woman, a man, or a pug, A+",1
2014,"The clipart-esque graphics aren't the most appealing and the lack of a narrator makes playing through the story levels less interesting, but it's still just as well made and fun to play of a physics puzzle game as it's spiritual ancestors, with more bits and bobs and more to come if it keeps getting updated",1
2012,"The only fault I can give this game is how much it overexaggerates the fun you can actually have with a shovel, top notch visuals, sound, gameplay and writing, maybe a little bit short but there's even more game on the way in the form of free updates, definitely beats shovelling dirt",1
2012,"You're not going to get much more than what you see here, but what there is is a well made extremely tight 2D platformer fencing simulator that is extremely fun to play with friends, maybe not as interesting against a CPU, recommend picking it up on sale because that price is pretty high for something with so little meat, even if it is quite tasty",1
2012,"The story kind of peters out without knowing what to do with itself and the grid assembled level layouts can end up feeling somewhat samey and uninteresting, but it's fun to play, controls great, looks and sounds good in a simple cartoony style, the cutscenes are hilarious, and it has a lot of personalization and fun multiplayer modes",1

2014,"Ok so firstly, if you are here for TF2 items then do not buy this game. The money isnt worth the TF2 items and when you buy the game it takes forever to get the items. Secondly, if you are looking for fun, look somewhere else, this game has low graphics and boring characters. Poker can be played on the internet for free.When you are aiming to get TF2 items in this game, you need to play poker for hours and hours and you must win in order to obtain the items. In this game, you must play poker and beat the other 4 players in order to win. There are 5 players in total: Yourself, Max, Strong Bad, The Heavy and Tycho. In order to win items you must keep playing games until you encounter someone coughing up some gear but you need to defeat that player and if anyone else defeats the player you lose the item. The items take forever to encounter and you have a low chance of winning the item. It take several hours or maybe even days to obtain them all. I have encountered items before but never received them.This game is not recommended unless you have fine skills at poker and you are desperate for these items. It is an absolute waste of money if you are trying to get the items. 4/10Chop2014",1
2014,"Awesomenauts. A great game. At first, the game is under estimated and is said to be ""Child's Game"" but when you actually get into the game it is very addicting. This 2D M.O.B.A has great graphics, great animations, excellent voiced characters and the gameplay is great. I could have never guessed that this simple game got so addicting and competetive. It's great for laughs, competetions and casual gaming. However, the skins for each character cost a lot of money even on sale. One character skin could be around $5.00 which is overpriced. There should also be an option where you can kick players who are feeding the other team because some players are feeders for the other team and sometimes some people just dont know what teamwork is. Overall this game is phenomenol and i absolutely love this game :DRating: 9/10 Chop2014",1

2014,"I played this game of the net about 4 years ago and it was an early access game. It was by far, probably the most high graphic MOBA (Dota 2 came out 2013) So i played a bit and it was awesome! Gameplay, mission, PVP, PVE. Mech, Upgrades, Perks and alot of other content made this game fabulous! But the game is still in BETA? No idea... Anyway here is my review:Airmech is a MOBA/RTS game that requires some strategy and your airmech to win the game.The Objective is to kill the robotic mobs, tanks, humvees etc.. and get enough XP to level, then destroying turrets, barracks and towers to get to the main base and destroy it. It is a bit like League Of Legends where you have to destroy the turrets and blow up the Nexus. Once you lose or win, you get a certain amount of XP and Credits depending on how many PVP Kills/BOT Kills/Mob Kills/Tower Kills. You can then use those credits to buy more airmech types, perks, upgrades etc... With a paid currency (That can be earnt through out F2P) you can buy skins for your airmech. This gamemode applies to PVP and a little bit of PVE as well. Different types of spawnable units can also be purchased through the shop. You can also complete missions to finish achievements, gain XP and gain credits as well. Simply, this game is a great MOBA/RTS on transforming robots, blowing up mobs, PVP/PVE and P2W. It is F2P but as long as you have the $$$ to spend you get to unlock Mechas faster, buy xp boosts and get exclusive upgrades. Another negative point is that it is still in Early Access mode? It has been 4 years since BETA version was here.The game developers say:What the developers have to say:“Play for free, keep your stuff! No resets at the end of Beta!All purchases and unlocks are permanent. We call it Beta because we're still adding some pretty big features, but so far we have:- Training and Solo play - for learning how to play, or casual fun- Coop and PvP Matchmaking - quickly get matched against others- Custom games and rules - when you want total control- Player driven economy - didn't need that drop? Sell it to other players!- Quests with ingame rewards - like Achievements, but better- Leveling, progression, unlocks - level yourself, your AirMechs, expand your army- NOT ""pay2win"" at all - check our reviews or ask players ingame- Global chat, Factions, parties - integrated directly into the core UI- Crafting system - added due to player demands- VIP/Premium for LIFE with any purchase - because we're cool like thatBut we have no idea when BETA will end and we can't keep this companies word for what they say sometimes since they have not always full filled the updates they have made in the past 4 years.8.5/10Tadlicated2015",1
2014,A great game that requires you to drain mummy's creddit card dry to win.,1
2014,"This game had so much potential on the day it was created with alot of fanbased projects. It really got the community going when it was first released and this game had a lot of potential. Trove is basically World Of Warcraft and Minecraft. The concept of MMORPG grinding is still there and there is the block building, breaking and making idea implemented in the game as well. Trove started to become a game loved by the community and Trion decided to add in more Pay To Win options in every single update. This is very true and Trion will probably never change it. After you zoom in to about 50 hours of the game, a few hundred dollars can change you from early game to late game. Their ingame purchase benefits are crazy and a few dollars spent makes up for a few days of grinding. Major in game benefits and boosts such as ""Patron"" (Which is like membership) costs IRL money and increases bonus stats by a crazy amount. However, Trove has ""tried"" to conceal the fact that they are money hungry beasts and added in a feature where each day has a different bonuses so free to play players can grind. This bonus doubled and increased if you have Patron, making Patron an extremely game changing thing. However, although Pay to Win is a major problem, free to play players can still thrive if you have hundreds of hours to burn monthly... To get to about mid game, Trion is only asking you to grind your soul out. It really isn't much of a big deal. (Note the sarcasm) Once you get to about mid game, you make very little progress daily even if you play a lot. Tge new level update to make the maximum level from 20 to 30 is so grindy. Now all the pay to win problems have been covered, I can now talk about the gaming bits of the game. As i said before, this game has the basic concepts of a fun MMORPG with dungeons and raids to do. This game doesnt really require much teamwork but farming in big groups would be ideal and easier. The hardest raids can be soloed sometimes and there are hardly any boss mechanics. A game like World of Warcraft or RIFT has raids and dungeons that requires strategic battle plans such as tanking, healing, pulling, aggro, dps, kiting, timing and positioning. Although tanking is required in the game and dps is as well, it doesnt really feel as exciting as an actual Raid or dungeon where you feel like you have contributed to the DPS charts. A carry can easily be invited into your raid and they can just one hit the bosses extremely quickly. After the tutorial of the game, there are hardly any more quests to complete which makes it boring becuase all you do in the game is Shadow Tower (Raids) and Dungeons. Adding in questing would really make the game alot stronger than it is and it really needs to be for a Pay To Win Game. Adding a questline would put more excitement and make the game more interesting. The biggest power rank booster in the game are gems, which at a certain point of the game is extremely hard to get in lots of amounts. To progress onto the worlds, you either sell your soul to the demon or spend $30. Trion really needs to rethink about how the game will be updated. The amount of hours you will spend grinding on this game will become unbelievable if you want to proceed to the end game stages and levels. Don't touch this game and want to goto end game in a few months unless you're allowed to drain mum's credit card.When i say it like this, i'm not even joking, just play this for fun. It's meant to be fun for the first 100 hours. ",1

2002,"This game is a very great one with more endings than the origanal, this game is a awesome 10/10P.S. My favourite ending is the confusion",1
2014,"When you complete this game, you fell ON TOP OF THE WORLD! This is a masterpeice of perfection. Almost, perfection. The whole really is a seris of patterns repeated in a random order. One thing I like was when the central hexagon turned into a pentagon or even a square. But that feature's not used alot, so that was a bit sad, but I can see it was just to add variety to the first/ fourth stage of the game.Overall, my FINAL rating for this game is a 9/10. Something just didn't seem right & for playing for a long time (not over an hour), my forth finger start to hurt a bit. But should you buy this game? YES!!! Is it worth $2.99? DEFINATELY!!!! So, all in all, get this game if you like fast-paced minimalist fast-paced hexagon-based arcade action! But don't if you have strange reactions to flashing lights or anything like that.9/10 would make a hexaflexagon again.Yep, another ?/10 would ? again joke.",1

2014,Splinter Cell Blacklist é um jogo de ação e stealth em que pode ser jogado tanto em coop e campanha quanto em multyplayer contra jogadores online. Recomendo muito o jogo por ser na minha opnião um dos melhores jogos da serie de Tom Clancy e pela sua dinamica de grupos totalmente diferentes : os mercenarios (cujo são uma classe mais pesada de infantaria com armas pesadas) e espiões (uma classe mais leve e agil com armas de baixo dano). Apesar do preço acho que valhe muito apena comprar pois a historia e a dublagem são exelentes e o multiplayer e o coop são muito bons.,1

2014,"Honest Reviewfirst thing is first, I have played path of exile for longer than my hours will show for. as I have multiple accounts that have been used/forgotten/mule/etc. but Steam is my main use of the game. roughly 1000+ hours is more accurate.What I can say honestly with Path of Exile is that it really gives you a feeling of satisfaction when you have built a design of a character, put it together over time, and it works. Theorycrafting became a job title and a hobbie. Spending hours on end simply coming up with a character that would win the game without even the currency to make it happen.So what have a done in the game?just about every piece of endgame content, I am still chasing a deathless Uber Atziri Kill, however I have been close on many instances.Pros-----Endless Character builds (it comes down to just how what knowledge you have of the game mechanics)-Passive Tree to get lost in-Guild community (Great game to play solo, but with others is just on another level)-Has Softcore and Hardcore gameplay-New Leagues constantly released / this means a new ladder leaderboard-Player Hideout to showcase your efforts-Leveling Up crafting masters to increase your Crafting options-over 100 achievements-Great ways to trade in game and through poe.trade (31/05/2016)-This is NOT a Diablo clone, and it really holds its own as a fresh and original gameCons-dying in HC can be frustrating -Crafting RNG can make you feel very unlucky at times-Main Chat can be full of random trash talkers/ not alwaysOverall--------So why do i still play?there is still soo much i can get out of the game, and when you least expect it, something crazy might drop, item or currency that will change your gameplay and style. but the satisfying feeling I get fast clearing high level maps at a chance of gaining loot thats so rare it makes you freak out rush to pop it in your inventory portal to your hideout and logout and pause yourself for a few moments to think... i just found a mirror...",2
2014,"So I am no veteran to salt, however I am a veteran towards sandbox titles in general, I have literally been scouring the web and steam for a game that can stand out from the rest with something players all love and crave while giving a new feel. I can honestly say that SALT has really done an incredible job the Dev's I take my hat off to.What I cannot believe is that I was just in time to see some real development in the game, as I began playing SALT just before this update was released, so I was able to see the ship models and textures before. after the update I was blown away by its detail upgrade. Highly recommend SALT and can only assume the best of its potential.I would say 10/10 but as I am only 2 hours in, I will have to give 8/10 until my excitement and enthusiasm dies down. Then my rating can be more accurate and see clearer.first 2 hours of gaming10mins - running running oh a chest12mins - reading craft manual14mins - boat.... i need a boat23mins - i have a boat =D30mins - sailing sailing sailing =D31mins - gathering materials from island to island50mins - spot an abandoned ship51mins - board the abandoned ship52mins - notice i can repair, but do not have materials1 hour 40mins - have materials and repaired pirate ship2 hours - sailing on my pirate ship not caring where I am going just going.looks to repair and own a bigger pirate ship",2

2014,"-=SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW=-If you have got patience, a passion for physics games and a great computer, then you should be able to enjoy this game.Octodad: Dadliest Catch wasn't one of the usual games I play. At the start we open with controlling Octodad, as you will throughout the game. This was one of the easiest sections in the game. Finding bowties, opening doors, and throwing objects at glass panes. It was a great way to do a tutorial, but as you walked down the carpet towards your bride, it became difficult. ""Don't let people notice you're an Octopus."" And by doing so, you had to avoid breaking things. And after each level there was the small chase with Octodad and The Chef. While running you'd have to continuously switch between leg and arm control as you moved objects out of your path. After mastering the switch the game starts to flow easier.Later on the game became progressively harder with it's challenges, such as the obstacle course in the aquarium. Moving across unstable platforms with lag was quite a tricky challenge, so I had to experience the game with my graphics set low. Also some people might notice the game glitching now and then. Items would mysteriously tear apart when you tried to grab them, or they'd get stuck in walls. It's a good little game, sad to see it finish so soon. The script was funny. I purposely took long periods of time to hear what some of the people had to say. . ""This is scarier than an ocean full of spiders. . And Tommy!"" ""Dad, if you left me here, fish would adopt me!"" I also really enjoyed the story line, which it's always good to have a nice story line for your game. So when you look past the glitches, the challenges and the odd physics with the default settings, It's actually a rather good game. Just I recommend the game for people who have good patience.",1

2009,"I love this game! So many puzzles and the stories are so dark, I love it.

2014,"Boring and overpriced - plain and simple. It's a good thing I bought this for $10 on special, because I enjoyed the game for around an hour, before realising that the basic game you're given, is really only worth $10. Sure you can tell they've tried to make the few routes they provide with the Steam edition visually appealing, and it seems like an authentic experience (I don't know much about driving trains, I'm not a professonal), but if sitting, staring at your screen for an hour, waiting for your train (from the minuscule selection you're provided to start with) to exceed the speed limit a little bit and then pulling a lever slightly is authentic, frankly I don't really care because this ""game"" is not necessary - I hate to be harsh, but perhaps if the dlc wasn't so expensive, I wouldn't care as much. I love trains, but this just isn't compelling.",1

I wanted a break from all those zombies and odd mutations in my games and i found this, This game is amazing to look at and a whole heap of fun at the same time on my first run i was minding my own buisness when i found a big red tower i walked up the mountain and up the stairs while i was there i started a fire but i was low on food so i went out to find some but just my luck a blizzard had swept in. so i warmed up grabbed the rifle on the wall and went out into the blizzard it was then i saw my first wolf just sitting their in the middle of the frozen lake i slowly aproached it and instantly and howl came out of the wolf and thats when i started running.10/10",1

2014,"HINT limit your carrying weight to bare minimum and make use of the sling shot early on!spawning in the southern 2 area and using up to 30 rocks with the sling shot while running backward(provided your light enough) on the CARBONEMYS will knock them out and they wont ever catch you while doing it and they r good body guards/take a beating. good vs TRIKES giving easy access to hyde early on. also have high torpor meaning plenty of time to forage for narco while waiting.hopefully that helps some people from dying a lot to a little, ive found it handy.This game will either become a classic and be in the gaming scene for years to come or influence a new generation of gaming.THIS is what sandboxing and crafting is about, well balanced and tweaking of settings is allowed? AWESOME and seemingly unheard of with games released lately.im 29 yrs old and have been playing games for 25yrs of my life on many many consoles but never been a computer person.Ive recently given up on consoles due to their lack of UI and mod support.this game has what ive been waiting for in games for awhile, although it may not have what everyone wants and it is limited to its style of game play the mod scene seems very active, the DEV's seem professional and busy and the community is awesome. the thing i like the most about this is the freedom to change almost all aspects of the games playability and keeping it fair to all players, ",1

2014,"The Shire Strikes BackIn the year 420AD, the hobbits from Bag End started a war to take over Middle Earth. The leader Corey English Baggins, the shorted leader of them all, he declared war on the Ewoks for the battle of Middle Earth. There I was, in the trenches of the Shire, me, myself, and my rifle sat there as we saw our fellow tiny comrades get gunned down by the MLG Ewoks. As I sat there and looked at my AK, I looked at my magazine, which was almost empty, I decided to take my last breath as I climbed up the trench towards the enemy. Before my eyes, an army of Ewoks were lurking toward my position so I decided to turn on my MLG sniping skills, I gunned the first squadron of Ewoks. As I look down my iron sights to shoot the next enemy approaching me, I got capped by an enemy parachuting from a bi-plane.I was on the ground bleeding out, thinking of my last memories of my loved ones. It was my time to go. Then appeared a great white bearded figure falling at the speed of light. He pulled two AK’s out of his cloak, and impaled the ground, leaving a crater so big that the enemy was almost wiped out completely. I couldn’t believe my eyes, it was our lord and savior, our profit, Gandalf the White. Gandalf swung his weapons of mass destruction and nut-shot every one of those little furry buggers. One by one, I heard the most glorious sound ringing in my ears, furry nuts exploding and bodies falling to the ground. Gandalf the White slowly lurked towards me and put out his hand and said, “I can see clearly now the Ewoks are dead, they are all dead and blown apart” The first wave of Ewoks were defeated, and that was just the beginning.Ten hours later, Gandalf the White was holding my hand in the hospital bed, stroking my arm. “It’s all ogre now son, it’s all ogre.” Legg the magnificent was watching through the observation window outside the hospital room. 10/10 –IGNThe New York Times- Best story ever, I was fully immersed in the story and got tears at the end! Would bang 10/10 I approve this message- Chuck Norris",1
2014,"Was an awesome game before they introduced combat, now the game has released i cant even play it anymore unless I buy it again. I spent $30 or so on the starter pack and they sent me a big F**K YOU after the game released and expired my pass. I wont buy it again just for the reason that the money I already spent on it is invalid. Was a 10/10, now a 1/10. Good job!",1
2014,The game that's always there when you're bored.,1
2014,This game is pretty far reich,1
2014,it will somehow make you wish you still had money in your wallet,1
2014,"Altogether a great game, so many possibilities in what you can add into the game or even make yourself. The multiplayer community is quite large, and the many differant game modes available each gives a differant gaming experience... Within G-Mod there is many gaming experiences to be had, alongside friends or just complete randoms, being a jerkwad in the sandbox servers, wreaking havok in the Dark RP servers, you name it, it can happen in gmod if you put your mid to it.I rate this game 8/10, not giving it full potato because of the age of this game and the sheer amount of errors and blank textures you will come accross, but it gains its solid 8 from the graphics, gameplay and sanbox capabilities.",1
2014,"Graphically awesome, the gore is ok to the extent of limb amputation and excessive blood, the atmosphere could use some work, the moments of when enemies will come out at you are predictable but the game is great if you want a good jump or just some dark atmosphere shooting/survival.",1
2014,"One of my favorite games ever, I played this for at least 2 months on the Xbox 360 before getting half way, the frustration, the obstacles and the blood pumping combat all drive it towards an unparallel feeling of achievment and self worth. The challenges in this game are immense, testing the very self discipline we all work towards, testing our patience and mettle, and in the end making us die, again and again. The graphics in this game are amazing, the combat is (mostly) realistic, the leveling system is quite unique, with many considerations to be had, the enemies are both gruesome and unforgiving, so I give this game a 9/10, because in the end nobody really likes to suffer over and over again (hence why only 9), but it is soo rewarding to overcome the obstacles ingame. But further consideration leads me to wonder: if the game wasnt frustrating, would it be as good?",1
2014,"Sure its a fine ""zombie survival"" game, but there isnt any ""zombie survival"", there is way too many PvP'ers out there casually killing everything that moves. The game itself (despite the PvP) is quite good, a nice looting system with a hunger and thirst system, they never truly developed the disease and medical system. The graphics are second rate, attempting a semi-realistic artstyle, that was ultimately only half accomplished. I rate this game 4/10, generally, gameplay is terrible, but the ideas behind it are great, perhaps hosting our own server to exclude all the PvP'ers would be a great idea, OH WAIT, THEY CHARGE $75 A MONTH FOR SERVER RENTING! WOW.",1
2014,"Previeously I stated that I did not recommend this game, because I was under the impression the game was a no-go, but (if you read the comments) this is infact false, and this is great news, because the game is infact fun to play and offers a unique gaming experience. I guess I was just disapointed that I had not seen any progress for a while :).The game itself shows a lot of promise, the idea behind the game is quite unique, the combat system interesting and the squad system pretty basic. They have developed a technological tree and base construction, great sandbox elements. They have an interesting market system with active trade routs, wandering bandits and several differant factions.",1
2014,"I bought this in Alpha, and now it has finally released :D, I am sooo happy at the progress they have made and I am glad I made the choice to support the alpha. This game is great for strategy fans, based all on the rules of exponential building and skills in managing massive armies, thinking quickly to counter enemy plans and trying to escape your planet when they launch their at you XD. I reccomend this game 10/10",1
2014,"This game is truly addictive, the combat system is simple, but amazing, fully engaging the player to the point that s/he is tilting on their chair just to get that right angle when swinging blades from a horse. The graphics are OK, but considering the date it came out it is very good. The diplomatic system is a bit dodgy but acceptable, the trade system is simple but effective, the leveling system and equipment are very good, leaving room for consideration of what to level based on what you need currently or how it could affect your character. The warband system is awesome, allowing you to have as many as 200 units or more tagging alongside your character, but having wages, moral and food distribution to worry about on the sidelines, while trying to avoid enemy lords and massive groups of bandits. I think i'll rate this game 8/10, because it just doesnt reach that very peak I am looking for in a medieval simulator, although it does get fairly close.",1

2013,"At the start of the game i ended getting stripped by a bunch of ♥♥♥ bandits then an imperial guard gave me some pants and i fled.

2014,You can shout at your down teammates and they'll get up11/5,1
2014,The benchmark of the Open World RPG. Little can be said on Skyrims shortcomings as the game is an experience that any 'Gamer' should have. The world is alive and it is easy to forget the quests and become a participant in the communities of Skyrim. The game is a brilliant time-sink and it is very easy to rack up hundreds of hours of gametime. The addition of thousands of user created mods enhance your game to your liking. The modding community is active and creative and is constantly producing new and interesting mods that add hours of fun to Skyrim.I cannot speak more highly of a game.,1
2014,"Solid Gameplay, Fun Career, Great Graphics are all for naught when you get a 10 place grid penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. All the frustrating trimmings that makes Formula 1 as tough and entertaining as the real thing. Great game 10/10",1

2014,Easily the most enjoyable First Person Shooter I've ever played. Complete immersion in this game is easy to achieve as you cannot but marvel at the dynamic landscapes and cinematic environments. The world of Bioshock Infinite is alive and you are subconsciously drawn into exploring the side streets and alleys for side quests and cash. 10/10 An Amazing Game.,1
2012,"Codemasters have done it again!, They are incapable of producing a bad racing game. 10/10 A+ 5 Stars, Loads of Fun.",1
2014,Rage inducing platformer that leaves a bloody reminder of how terrible you are after each restart. Great game to play with friends. WARNING! Homicidal Tendencies are amplified during your play through. The game does not hold your hand which is to be commended. A real sense of accomplishment is felt after completing the tougher stages which I have found to becoming less present in todays Video Games. Highly Recommended.,1

2014,"It's an early access game so I'll give it that for it being this good that is. It is a pretty good game, nice graphics. It is not too violent. Warning itis really laggy on a X32 bit laptop, but mildly laggy on a X64 laptop. Nice graphics as I said before, but I found it quiet empty. Online is fun and so are workshop creations I would give it 6/10!",1
2014,I LOVE this game it is the best experience for Star Wars fans (especially with mods). It is really good for a 2005 game. For parents this game is fine even though it is M. I rate it 9 or 10 yrs+ and 10/10!,1
2013,"The only reason I recommend this game is because it is free. It is a bit to hard since the zombies don't go away in the day, plus you loose everything. There should be a setting where you can keep your items. Rehealing is really hard to do. I can never find medicine. Plus the zombies are way too fast! By the way this is pretty much a demo. There is a gold mode but that only really unlocks new skins to wear and some sort of new difficulty called, you guessed it 'gold'. This is only a early access game so I will give it that. I rate it 5/10. I recommend you try the game though. It has it's moments... =)",1
2013,Light some dynamite and chase people until it explodes killing you and the enemy....10/10 Would Suicide bomb again.,1
2013,"Just Cause 2 is a game with many great features. I love this game and I can't wait for Just Cause 3! So here are the Pros and ConsPros:-Open world-Great map with a mix of ocean, snow, desert, city and forest/jungle-Black market system-Cool structures/locations such as miltary bases, big buildings such as the casino, blimp, docks and more-Nice machanics such as being able to shoot tyres, grapple hook, parachute, tether hooking and bing able to destory governement structures-Lots of explosions-Great mods-Criminal factionsCons:-Not enough variety in weapons-NPCs don't care if you point a weapon at them-Some other NPC AI faults-No built in multiplayer (you can still download the free fan-made multiplayer mod on steam, but that doesn't have any NPCs in it)-Not a very good story",1

2013,"Highly addictive rhythm based action game, which successfully combines two of the greatest things in the world, ever: Prog Rock and Gaming.  Excellent title!",2
2014,"Quite simply one of the most playable, fun, epic shooters ever.  Single player is a blast, multi-player is phenomenal, and the effort to grab the best loot in the game adds a surprising but welcome level of depth to the proceedings.The DLC is absolutely essential though, and unlike many other games, it's priced perfectly (well, ok, maybe not the extra classes, a little pricey for what they are) and along with the extra game modes only enhances what is already a great experience.  In an age where £44.99 usually buys you a game with two hours of solo play, and infinite but boring multiplayer options, Borderlands 2 still effortlessly manages to enthrall, engage and entertain, playthrough after playthrough.Did I mention it's also one of the funniest games ever?It's big, clever and a work of insane genius.

2013,"What can I say.It's Dragon Age: Origins.My favourite game of ALL TIME. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. The fighting is complex and makes you think about your next move. It's in depth, which you can spend HOURS reading about, the character development for every party member is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic on so many levels, the variety of enemies to fight is just beautiful. I truly believe that if bioware were to make another game like this I'd suck a whole lot of ♥♥♥♥ to play it. The soundtrack is gorgeous. The environments are fantastic, and the bosses. Oh the bosses.They're actually difficult! It's incredible! Buy this game and play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. Also Ps don't use wintersday gifts if you actually wanna get some satisfaction out of conquering leliana. :^)10/10",1
2013,"Literally one of my favourite games ever.Lots of replayability, lots of hidden stuff that will rock your socks off, and lots of guns.Like. LOTS of guns. Dialogue is fantastic, gameplay is fantastic, shootouts are cool, soundtrack is awesome, and all the character development is really cool. Dlc is definately the highlight of the game, vanilla is boring compared to the dlc, and the dlc has tons of replayability as well.I have a few gripes with this game, as I do with any game, and they are that the npc ai is kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥, some weapons are obsolete compared to others, and the way the game can force you into bad situations like in sierra madre dlc is kinda offputting, creating a sense of artificial difficulty if you haven't put points into your skills right. Healing items are too plentiful early, and too scarce late, making you have to level up science and search the wastes for broc flowers and ♥♥♥♥. Although besides all that stuff the game is still fantastic. Get it and play it at your closest convinience.8/10",1
2013,"This game is just amazing. I can't think of what to say.It's been so long since I've played a game with so much charisma, and so much personality, it was such a refreshing experience. It has so many things that'll just knock you down and make you laugh for hours in it, which might take a playthrough or two to find, I can't express how much I love this game accurately enough, I hope there's a Jazzpunk 2 because that would make me so happy.11/10 I need some Work enhancing drugs.",1
2007,"First of all I'm gonna give a little PSA.This game is suffering.It is a rage enducing, mind crushing, rationality destroying piece of ♥♥♥♥.If you can get past that, then it's the greatest ♥♥♥♥ing game ever.The final boss killed me one hundred times, the under water level is suffering, and I love it.The soundtrack is gorgeous, expecially the final boss track (which was the only damn thing that kept me trying to beat it.) and the animation is bright, and cute. This game is not for people who get angry at video games, nor people who think that platformers should be easy. Over all I say this game is the best thing ever 12/10 buy it you nerds.",1

2013,"Really great game, the developers are helping the community by bringing modding support in the future. Driving mechanics nice, however update frequency is quite low. Although we aren't given much updates, when we get them the updates are awesome and fully packed, unlike Beam.ng drive which updates only for one paintjob they added.",1
2013,"Really good game. The drift physics are fun and the multiplayer keeps me entertained. You can tune your cars and even though you may start with a terrible car, you can mod it to be like superman if he was a car. but with these pros there still comes cons. Here is a list for those who can't read poorly formated text:Pros: - Good drift physics (really fun and challenging if you have a faster car, but still fun)- Tunable cars (Really entertaining, and keeps you playing, also the possibilitys are endless)- Many variations in cars- Multiplayer (both lan and online multiplayer)- More features are still to come as this is not a finished gameCons:- Most Quality Graphics?? This is not a game for testing your new Nvidia Titan X. Quake has better graphics.although the only reason why I would say the graphics aren't good is because of the models, they are low poly however the car models are fine, just the map and such. The textures maybe a little too. The graphics are playable and decent though- FPS cap. So we don't have much of a graphics intensive game, which may be good for you guys with not so good specs, but now we have bumped into an fps cap :/ However, this will probably be removed in the future.- People who crowd around multiplayer and crash into you. (Collision atleast in spawn needs to be off)Overall, the game is great, and is like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas drifting but in one game, and improved in all the ways possible but graphics. Hopefully someone can make an enb mod for this :P",1
2013,"Great game, only crashes when you are using too much CPU power for me. I can blow everything up, and when I use too much CPU, that includes my computer! I can run it though with my horrible CPU at 60+ fps on medium, and I am using a i3-4130 with a GTX 960 Overclocked DIRECT CU II 2gb whatever. This is a really good game and I haven't even beat it, I've just been flying around or driving cars. I don't know how this will go for recording on to my youtube channel though :/",1

Other than that this game is totally awesome; Gameplay, Graphics, Controls, Fun, You don't need to ask no more cause all of that stuff ar bundled into the game. 100% Sure you'll not get bored.

2013,real gud,2
2013,"This game is great, really, it is. But to play it you need at least 4-5 hours to get all the gear, travel to the right places, and kill some people along the way. This game is a must buy, because once the full release is out, expect the price to sky-rocket.",2
2013,now your gonna have alot of fun when your breaking into a bank with your friends. this game is alot of fun and the missions are very lengthy but theres only a few of them but that isnt to bad considering the missions take about 30-45mins to complete but overall me and sirsonic11 have been having a blast with this one so im going to give a badass score of 8.7 money bags out of 10,1
2013,FTL is a game where the entire galaxy is layed out in front of you where you will be running and fighting the rebel fleet and other various enemy types also this game is brutal cause once you die thats it you have to start again so that raises the stakes and rewards you even more when you do well and there are a variety of mods available and ships ranging from stealth ships and mods include star trek and another hit series joss whedon's firefly. Overall this game is truly spectacular even with the simple graphics i give it 9.5 aliens on a ship,1
2013,now i could say bad or good things about this game but i shall say both. this game is like battlefield 3 and its squad basedd gameplay is really fun vehicles are excellent sci fi but the cintrols for them arent friendly to new comers but in the end i give this game a good enough score of 7.8,1

Includes props and stuff from most of the valve games such as Half Life (Mainly) and Team Fortress. Steam Workshop is available. Game used to make Youtube's Gmod movies and other projects.A microphone is recommend if you' re playing in a co-op mode to increase the fun. But mind some of the ragers with mics if you find any. It has a moderator system in case this or something else happens. But other than that averagely nice sandbox.",1
2013,"This is an excellent contender for a 2D Retro-type Minecraft. But tsk! Tsk! You shouldn't deem this game to be a 2D Minecraft. This game has its own name to be called in its own right: Terraria. It has a lot of freedom when it comes to creativity with a passionate hint of RPG-ness and the hard boss battles. Multiplayer is Steam supported and very easy to set up. Great classic must have indie game. Psst! It's very addictive too! Very addictive, if you get hooked on this game you'll will expect to bundle a lot of hours together dedicated to playing this game.UPDATE: The new update 1.3 has revolutionised this game.

2013,"Pros- Beautiful environments and graphics, looks like a painting most of the time.- Amazing writing and voice acting.- Great gameplay.- Most of the story is very interesting and engaging.Cons- Very short and a bit overpriced, only takes about 3 hours to finish.- The ending sucks.Suggestions- Add some more content. Not DLC (unless it's free), actually just update the game and add something.- Improve the graphics a little. Don't change how it looks, but maybe use Sunshine on the asset store to add some volumetric light or something.- Add some wildlife to the environment. It'll just make it feel a bit more alive.If you're looking into getting the game, you really should. But only buy it if it's on sale or you have a discount, because it's not worth the full price.",1
2013,"Without spoiling anything, let me give you a basic summary of each run:- Neutral Run - The one you do the first time you play- True Pacifist - World's most effective feels trip- Gencide Run - Bad Time Simulator 201XSeriously though, get this game.

2013,THIS GAME IS AMAZING! it Beats Killing Floor 1 by a long mile! Even though its in early access. This game has great graphics and visuals. Amazing Gameplay. Still Badass SlowMo. And more zombies. This game is flawless other than it having little weapons and getting little amounts of money. This is well worth the $309/10,1
2013,This is the game of my dreams. I swear I dreamt this up when I was a young kid.,2
2013,Tf2 is my girl but I once played a game in the ranking system learnt how to play as my team carried me. 10/10 people thought I was trolling when I actually had no idea.,2
2013,"The game is gorgious. The combat is deep and exciting, a thing most fps games lack. And a plot twist that you will never guess until you finish and say to yourself “did that just happen?”Note: played about 10 hours offline",2
2013,"Its not as bad as people say it to be. It was boycot by its ""fans"" the dlc was never completed because of 2k Australia death.The game smooths out kinks with Borderlands 2 it creates new movement possiblities and better for dodging by adding Oz kits. However I wish that they killed you faster when you had no oxygen left. Its not really a big deal but thats my opinion.UVHM isn't revolved around slag. Borderlands 2 was slag simulator 2012 and made the game monotonous and boring. Slag the enemy switch to another gun. Slag the enemy switch to another gun. Slag the enemy switch to another gun. That was basically all you would do. The Pre-Sequel adds Cryo as a replacement for slag and honestly, its a much more fun element to use and creates more a diverse way to play UVHM.The story was told through in a narative way by Athena, one of the vault hunters which was a great way to tell this story. It makes you feel sorry for what happened to Jack and makes him an even more detailed character. Who doesn't love Jack?THE VAULT AREN'T MUTES. THEY ACTUALLY COMMENT ON THE SITUATION.All of the vault hunters are great characters to play and are all equally viable throughout the game if equiped with the right gear. So if you want to grab this game pick it up on sale if you are still uncertain but I'm sure you will get your money's worth either way.",2

That after 4 hours of fun and awesome gameplay Chivalry now comes up with the message ""UDK.exe has stopped working"". Now this is really frustrating i mean i tried the usual: Uninstall then reinstall but of course that didn't work. Torn banner please fix.

DeathMatch is alot of fun and can be played when you don't have much time but want to have some fun. Arms Race is a fast paced game. It can be alot of fun. Compettive is alot of fun and I really like the way it work. You have to buy your wepons at the begining of the Round. Rounds go about 4 min I would say and there are 30 Rounds in a Game.

The game just didn't really get me excited during the time i played; and it seemed repetitive with the quest just saying kill this, detroy this, and collect this.

2013,I felt like a completionist playing Rochard. The whole plot i didn't really enjoy taking part in. It felt a bit kiddish and dumb. But that didn't stop me from enjoying the gameplay. The gameplay was quite cool and fun. And for a bad puzzle gamer. It felt a bit easy for a long time. But easily later in the game i got stuck. It was a good puzzle game for making someone like me enjoy it. So for that im gonna give it a thumbs up!,1
2013,I see no point in a game like this. It was just place ships and then sit there and watch. I was constantly doing something else while waiting for it to end. Its a miracle that i put this much time into it. Sadly most boring game i have ever played.,1
2013,"Im very half half on this game. I dont like the graphics and the sounds/music. But i like the arcanoid style gameplay. That made it seem very nostalgic for me. And also it added cool bosses, skills, and way to get items plus it had a storyline and quest to go with the whole thing making it a rpg/arcanoid game. Which i thought was cool. I did finish the game and i guess i enjoyed doing so. Even though core aspects of the game were bad in my opinion. Im still gonna give this game a thumbs up.",1

2013,"Sakura Clicker is in every form just another clicker game; just like Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes, etc. Just because this clicker game features Anime girls, with big boobs, and moaning sound effects, doesn't really seperate it in anyway from the rest of the genre. You could see these features as the games way to pull you in, just like a good opening paragraph. This game is practically endless, but can have a completionist end. To ""complete"" Sakura Clicker, you have to basically get every possible spirit upgrade. Spirit upgrades are basically this games way of making you want to play it more. You get spirits by restarting the game. You can only restart after getting a certain way into the game, which is usually inbetween Zone 13 to 20, with 20 being basically the have to restart point early on in the game, because of how long it takes to kill anything. These spirits allow you to buy upgrades (which I am hoping will have a definite end, if not, I will be spending way longer than anticipated playing this time waster of a game), which give you buffs for when you start over, to make you feel overpowered, and progress through the game faster, slowly reaching to the point where you quit last time, and hopefully passing that point. Now do I like this game? Well yeah, and it's not for any idiotic reason, like enjoying the moaning sounds (I have had the game muted most of the time, so that I can do other stuff while it is left in the background), but it is generally because it is a good time waster. If you see this game as anything but a time waster, then you have generally suprised me. If I would have to critique the game, I would say that it had a hard time running it along side normal internet activities, without giving my computer lag issues. This isn't necessarily a problem, because I can close the game, and just check on it within however long I chose to leave it dorment in my Steam library. But despite this not really being a problem, I would love an option to get rid of these laggy features (I am guessing the money flying all over the place is the main culprit for lag).I will recommend this game, because it will continue to fill in the gaps of my bored, shut in life. If you have nothing better to do, get Sakura Clicker, it's not like scrolling down your Facebook newsfeed, or watching dumb Youtube videos, are in anyway better than clicking on big breasted Anime girls.",1

2011,"7/10 fun game, but I wouldn't reccommend this game (3/10) for SERIOUSLY IDIOTIC checkpoints. Would be MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better with more frequent Checkpoints, or the ability to save in the middle of a game, since players can't continue where they left, we HAVE to restart from the beginning if you quit in the middle of game",1

2013,"AWSOME GAME!!!! apart from rooms crashing and hackers in the begginer rooms it is fun, hard to start of but after you reach higher ranks the game becomes easier.   with a variety of game modes to sute EVERYONE, like fire team a mode where you have to complete a mission against CPUs, Quarantine regn where you killz thee zombnies or get infected, and also plain elimination and arms race where yuo start of with a gun and every 3-4 kills youn get with the gun youget a new and better gun. P.S. (note guns cost GP (gear poiunts) which you earn in games but you buy guns for 7 days or 30,90 or perm if you have NX or a GP perm sale is on. NX is a form of currency which you BUY with real money, even though it is free to play if you buy/earn NX you can buy better guns for longer and for perm)HAVE FUN IF YOU ARE BEGGINGERS!!!!!!!!!!P.S.S.  (note HAVE FUN AND DON'T HACK IT RUINS THE GAME)P.S.S.S. (note  DO NOT GLITCH BEACAUSE NEXON PATCHES GLITCHES UP BY CREATING A KILL ZONE WHERE YOU DIE INSTANTLY AND IF YOU DIE THAT WAY YOU GET A GREY NAME IN GAME WHICH MEAND THAT ANYONE, ANYONE EVEN ENEMIES CAN SEE YOUR POSTION)                                                                    NEXOWNED!!!",1

2003,"Loved this game. The whole atmosphere was amazing, so if you've got good headphones, use 'em! I'd recommend playing alone, in the dark - more exhilerating that way, and helps you take on the role of the child.",2

2013,"A very good game for builders,Minecraft players and persons with creative minds out there.It totally beats other sandbox games because in Garry's Mod you can do almost anything.Sure other times it crashes but hey,its your computer'/community addons' fault if you crash.Sure it gets boring playing around with the vanilla one after a while but you can  still download some addons in the workshop which makes the game more interesting.Tired of playing sanbox?Play other gamemodes then.There are many gamemodes in the game that will surely liven up your game and all of these are just only a fraction of Garry's Mod awesomness.",1
1999,"Destroyed 32 T-34s,10 recon choppers,10 T-64s,15 Mobile SAMs and 1 FOB with a single platoon of M1A2(HC)Abrams 10/10 would ♥♥♥♥ Stalin again.",1
2013,"My first hour of Rust.Spawned in radiation zone and died within seconds.I got banged by a rock to the face.I built my first shelter.I died from coldness.I tried to kill wolf with rock,failed.I got killed by zombie.I got chased by zombie.I got chased by wolf and came across a bear.Someone helped me and killed wolf.And got some resources.I got chicken meat out of wolf :PI ate chicken meat. I was poisoned.I died hungry.10/10 would do again",1
2013,"My IMO score: 10/10Why?Don't have to answer Roman's calls anymore because he isn't in the game.Seriously though here are my points:Story: I haven't played it yet but based on my brother's gameplay,it is really well crafted and very unpredictable except for some parts. There are also a lot of twists in the story.The inclusion of 3 protagonists was also done very good with each of their respective Special Abilities. Cheat codes are fun too!Online: I played about 99% of my time in Online. The community as I expected is SOS or shoot-on-sight kind of players so you don't really have a room for making friends. The real fun comes when you are playing with your friends. The jobs are actually good and make a really stable source of money.Beware though,vehicles are very pricey and it will be a while until you bought your first legitimate vehicle.  It will still be longer before you bought your first apartment too! Although they are very expensive, they give you a safe haven from the rampaging players that shoot you down with no remorse. They also give your owned cars a safe place where other players can't blow them up and you have to call the Insurance company to get it back. The most expensive ones looks something that only Iron Man can buy,hell, the Garage already looks like a house.HEISTS:  my favourite part of Online. They are cooperative missions that need good teamplay and effective communications. The succeeding heists after the first one are extremely hard without teamwork but it really feels good once you bring home the bacon. It gives you a darn lot of money especially if you are heist leader (I got 200k once). The problem is that most of the players who joins your heists are 1). Noobs who cant do ♥♥♥♥. 2.) People who don't know what to do. 3.) people who Perform their roles poorly and 4.)just incompetent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who sit around ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ while you and possibly others are getting ♥♥♥♥♥ by the police. However, when someone you know or trust gets together on one crew, you can have actually fun and it doesn't even feel that you are competing. You also burn through heists quickly and you level up fast. Optimization: Hell, this console port doesn't even feel like it! Truly the PC Master Race has prevailed. The graphics looks very beautiful. The streets and cities are very lively. The effects are truly stunning. All this runs on my decent laptop with the following specifications:GTX 860M(Single)Intel Core i7-4710HQ 2.5Ghz-3.416 GB RAM.It runs around 40-60 FPS on Very High settings with no AA and on 1920x1080!There is a little stuttering and screen tearing but it isn't really noticeable and it is just probably my eyes getting damaged from playing GTA V constitently.Well, that's all I could say for this review. This review will be updated as the game also updates on PC",1

There sometimes are desync issues with the server (ALWAYS ONLINE) which can be annoying but not a major problem.",1

Men der er ikke penge nok for dig at bruge på nye og våben og atachments ting og de ​​crafting omkostninger alt for meget. De nye stealth mekanik er en væsentlig forbedring.

2013,"World at war.. Probably the best Cod I have played since black ops 1. (yes I was a late starter into the cod franchise.) People still play this for not only the awesome multiplayer.. But for the custom zombies. The effort map makers put into their maps makes people want to go and get this.. Hell If it wasn't for them I wouldn't have touched this game. I HIGHLY recomend it! 10/10!! For people looking for custom maps to play I recomend Cheese Cube and Prission Mission by ZK, and also Chaos Island V2 (if you want a challenge!)",2

2013,"Garry's Mod, Published by QuickScope Studios, is an RPG, FPS game.You play as John Hardwood, a man travelled back in time by his physics teacher to face his greatest enemy, 'Faze Clan'. You journey through endless maps, ranging from an open jungle - to a snow mountain. The story is set in a western theme, with cowboys and indians chasing you through the landscape. The Qui2CkScope Engine runs this game very nicely, with clean, hardcore 3D polygon models for a bit of eye candy while playing only makes the game that much better. The real gameplay flys in when you reach the alpha stage - also known as the Trickshot 420 Stage. The stage involves you trying to hit a 750 noscope double tap yy to semtex cancel 420 snoop lion blaze shot, when there standing infront of you, Faze Clan. The ending was quite thought out and well done, with you finally taking the last hit and teabagging the Faze clan. Overall a must have for any hardcore noscopers out there!   - 10/10",1
2013,"Rust - Developed by Facepunch Studios.This game is quite enjoyable, although I would have to say it does have some flaws:1. There are no goats, cmon Facepunch you could of atleast added goats.2. There are no killcams or SnD gamemodes, SnD is a vital part of any FPS game, Rust has no other gamemode than 'survival'3. There are no lens flares, while playing I noticed that there aren't any lens flare whatsoever, we need lens flares J.J Abrahms would not approve of this and quite frankly,  I don't either.4. No woodcutting skill. If you're going to make a game, always add a WC skill so players can ask other players ""WC level?""5. That rock is so ♥♥♥♥ing overpowered, ok so I was playing, collecting wood and ore as I usually do, and nek minut I got qouted in the head with a rock! I ♥♥♥♥en got KO'ed and lost all my ♥♥♥♥.6. There aren't any carrots, honestly if there aren't carrots, there is no point playing. Carrots would be a nice touch in this game.7. Rabbits. These ♥♥♥♥ing rabbits that get around thinking they own the damn place. These lil ♥♥♥♥♥s run around and cause all kinds of mischief, they have so much perversity, and I cant even get a ♥♥♥♥ing shot with my .22 because they're too damn fast.8. Red animals - These red animals literally ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up, I stand around 10 metres away from them, but nope I'm too ♥♥♥♥ing close to there personal space. They drop some pretty nice ♥♥♥♥ but still.Other than that it's a pretty good game. 10/10",1

2013,"This game is simply stunning. Firstly, the gameplay is fluent when you need it to be, (in epic, drop assassinations and a quick escape) and dramatic and well-paced when it needs to be (when you're planning how to slink around Dunwall, or dodging guards like the badass you know you are). While the game focuses a lot on its polished stealth mechanics, violent, overt styles are generally ""frowned upon"" and the player may feel especially persuaded to put down the ever-so-loud pistol and swap back to the good ol' fashioned blade and blink the game wants you to use. But in saying this, I wouldn't precisely call this a negative.The good thing about Dishonored is that you can play it again and again and try a different style everytime. I've played through it about 4 times now and even then I realize that there is so much more I can be doing. Don't like the stealthy style? Want a bit of a challenge? Flip the system the bird and run in, guns blazing and rats swarming. Feeling edgy? Want to be the dark and mysterious character you know you can be? Equip your dark vision and crossbow and slink around like an actual assassin.The plot is predictable, but you'll easily see past that when you immerse yourself in the lore rich world of Dunwall. Littered like candy wrappers at a park, you'll find all sorts of books, clippings and conversations  that hint and tease at the world of Dunwall. Drunken sailor chants tell you of the dark and violent histories of the City, intelligent scriptures of scholarly standard describe the mysterious Outsider and small talk between the servants of mansions will tell you of the current affairs, generally murder, plague and poverty.And you can't leave out the confronting and generally awesome artwork and landscape. Brilliantly crafted, Dishonoured's graphics do well at setting a dark and gloomy mood that brings a fantastic view to the Steampunk genre. Tall, crooked buildings, decorated in pipes, cogs and other steampunk personifications make Dunwall so lovable and real. Hound Pits Pub flyers hang like dead bodies from notice boards, weathered walkways are tainted with putrid rats and corpses, homes are only made warm by the people inside as they lack food and security. Overall, buy this game, play it 6-7 times and immerse yourself in the stunning world of Arkane Studio's Dishonored.",1

If you have ever wanted to experience what it is like to go hunting you have to play this game, the graphics are fantastic and i have had no preformance issues... so far.a really big downside is that it is free to play meaning basically all the good elements of the game require in game purchases with real money. this frustrates me as to have a good gaming expierience you would have to pay at least $10 for a hunting license and about $5 for a good gun. A game like this shouldn't be free to play but a one off purchase as it would allow more people to get involved and overall make the experience more worthwhile.",1

Super Recomendado.DLC: Pues, poco que decir.

Unturned is great fun for friends who want to hang out, have fun and kill zombies. I would most recommend playing with a friend or group of friends on a personal or public server.

2013,"I really wouldn't compare this game to other zombie survivals such as the Left 4 Dead Series and the Call of Duty Zombies series. I really enjoyed both series and have grown to love Killing Floors new take on gameplay such as the removal of Crosshairs and the lack of endless waves like CoD Zombies. The game has 7 classes. Demolitions, Sharpshooter, Commando, Firebug, Field Medic, Support Specialist, and Bezerker. Each class takes a while to level up (A while meaning that it could take a month grinding out a class to the max level of 6.) so if you're a completionist then you can take the time to grind out your classes if thats your thing. The achievement hunters will have a couple hundred achievements to get. Some like the Hell on Earth achievements (Max difficulty achievements) can take a very long time to get due to how difficulty Hell on Earth can be. Simply put, Killing Floor might have a dead playerbase, but if you gather up some friends there's lots of fun to be had.Also.LODESAMONE.",2
2013,"This is a soley teamwork related game with many gamemods to choose from and an AI Director that keeps making random experences everytime and special infected that require a team to fend off this game couldn't get any better I could explain in detail all the gamemods but here are the basicsCampaign- This gamemode pits you against AI hordes and special infected with human controlled team mates which requires close teamwork to survive each finale from holding out to collecting gas to even running across a bridge thats being bombed by the militarySingle player- Nothing much to say about this game mode its the normal campaign but instead of humans its offline botsVersus- In Versus you are pitted against swarms of common infected while fending off human controlled specials each team takes turns playing as humans and infected with these playable infected and non playable infected: The Smoker- He will drag survivors with a long tounge towards him and will repeatidly bash them untill their team mates free them or they die if he can not directly drag them to him he will constrict them where they are stuck. The Boomer- Nothing much to explain about him he is a bloated infected who will throw up boomer bile on the survivors attracting a horde to attack them and attractting nearby infected if killed he will explode showering bile on nearby surfaces and survivors their is an item that allows the survivors to use his own bile against him. The Hunter- A hooded teenage looking infected who will leap great distances to catch lone survivors dealling massive damage untill killed or freed can leap from far and high places to deal damage pounces which range around 1 to 25 damage dealling instant damage and is the only infected that does not have to wait for his ability to recharge. The Charger- This infected has a large arm that will smash into survivors knocking other team mates into the air he cannot be bashed off his victim normally having to be killed a Charger may also ram survivors off high places incapping or killing instantly. The Jockey- The Jockey is the only infected that can move their victim around willingly instead of the Chargers ram which cannot be steered as well as the Smokers pull and Hunters pounce The Jockey can be fought against though if the survivor mashs their move buttons making it difficult for the Jockey to move them but they also deal damage much like the others clawing at their victims face untill downed and unable to ride like the Hunter it must pounce to capture someone. The Spitter- Purely a support infected like the Boomer the Spitter can split survivors with her acid spit or can spit on incapped or ""pinned"" survivors spreading panic and killing the survivor quicker making it a valuable asset to the team if used correctly like the Boomer its death has a last act of revenge spreading its acid although smaller on the ground like its spit attack. The Tank- The Tanks the brute force and favorite of most players the Tanks only goal is to spread damage to kill or make a miserable mess of the survivors defences with 3 different attacks like its punch attack which knocks back survivors knocking them senseless for a short amount of time a rock throw attack taking out snipers who aren't willing to take any damage from the behemoth and knocking them down giving the Tank a chance to get close and a car/object punch which sends any car or object flying and immediatly incapping survivors or on rare chances stumbling them or killing them making it very effective at taking out close groups and clusters. The Witch- The Witch is one of the only infected thats avoidable only attacking when disturbed killing and incapping in one hit being startled by flashlights and close survivors.Realism and Realism Versus- Realism is a gamemode of pure teamwork being unable to see someone through walls or being pinned also Witches will kill in one hit Realism Versus is purely the same as Versus defualt just with the added rules of Realism.Survival- Much like the Call of Duty gamemode Zombies but with a twist the survivors are able to equip anything they like before they start the match and instead of rounds its random hordes and Tanks as well as a timer recording how long your team survived 2 alteritive Mutations( We will get to these) are Survival Versus which is Survival with Versus merged and one team sets the time while the other beats it and keeps going till one team does not beat the others time and Hold Out which is like a Hold Out finale but quicker to finish.Scavenge- A quick version of Versus one team must collect gas cans and put them in the generator while the infected team must try and stop them from beating their score the first team to beat their score all added together wins the match.Mutations- Weekly gamemodes like Hunting Party, Last Man On Earth and TAAAANK! that are available on the Steam Workshop along with other community made skins and Campaigns that are remixes of gamemodes or entirely new ones as earlier mentioned Survival Versus is one such gamemode.Now for the conclusion this game has its ups and downs like its prequel but its worth buying the glitchier but funner version on P.C with the custom content and free DLC some players do not like the lack of weapons while most like it cause its simple and means your favorite weapons never too far from reach but what about the gamemodes? are some even worth playing? It is true that Survival and Scavenge are not played as much like Mutations mostly cause most players normally have enough time on their hands to play a full Campaign or Versus match and most of the Mutations that are fun require manual installation or having to be found in the wasteland of the Steam Workshop but this does not mean its not a bad game I rate it 9/10 Cause of its teamwork based gameplay which I have yet to see in many games and plus Valves style of simplicity with simple graphics and not overly complicated gameplayer (I am looking at you Battlefield and Call of Duty) this games a hit and miss some people will like it some will not but I absolutely love it as I have played the first since it came out and loved that even though I was missing alot such as weapons and items and lacking infected varity but its simplistic gameplay style contributes to it so thats my review and have a great day!",2
2013,"In my opinion this game is the pinnacle of the Fallout series. Combining the previous games skills, perks and specials systems with better combat and a better story than FO3. Its not just the best of the series, but also one of the best games to date. Graphically the game is very dated but it'll at least run on a Windows 7 and up PC without needing to find a workaround like FO3. So basically, you should get it. On sale of course.",2

2013,this is a awesome game it is like assasssins creed but with out assassinenting peaple you have guns and out REALLY soon is a mutiplayer mod its free(the mod NOT the game) and now i'm gonna play it have fun-max maker,1
2013,great game its hard but you keep coming back (though i may suck at it) it took me 24 days to get out and usely i give up but i keeped comeing back so great game and im readdy to take 48 days to get out on the next also i love what they are gonna add 1st they will add mutiplayer if posssable and 2nd prison editer 3rd person editer so i say buy it if you have the money.,1
2013,Awesome game! A must-buy as it is really cheap now. It's like Malaysian GTA with the great grapple hook and parachute combo and the whole point of this game is to blow everything up! It's like a interactive action movie!,1
2013,As a person who normally doesn't like strategy games this game was fantastic! Simple to play but really hard to master. Everything looks and feels very nice but the multiplayer could be better with the freezing but is fun with friends if it run smoothly,1
2013,Unfortunately this is the only tennis game on steam but its pretty good. The world tour is fun but can get a bit repetitive at times.,1
2013,The managing aspect of the game is boring and doesn't make sense. The 3D races are enjoyable but I wish we could get something like the console version of the game ported to the PC.,1
2013,Good!,1
2013,Really fun multiplayer game! Well optimized and takes the best parts from the first game with now RPG elements. Only get this game if you have friends to play with because the bots are awfully useless. The game feels rushed with the levels (e.g. no 7 day heist) and the lack of safehouse customization. The game is great though!,1

2013,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU LIVE IN AUSOr really any other place where there is not a really dense mass of people playing this game. Currently, I have found no public servers in my time playing the game. This means that when I hit ""Play"" it drops me into the nearest server it can find, which is probably hosting in Russia or something because I get about 5000ms ping. It's actually impossible to play sometimes, as in you can't move or anything because of this.I can live with there being no players, as long as the game is playable. But, there is no way to host your own server without paying somebody to do so, and I've already wasted enough money on this game.When it is working, so far I have found no food in my ENTIRE PLAY TIME. Meaning I have starved to death WITH EVERY CHARACTER. I have encountered NO PLAYERS. And in fact, on the most recent update of the game I haven't even seen and zombies either.Pros:- NoneCons:- No players- No servers (Playing from Aus, this means I get so much ping the game is uplayable)- No local hosting- No zombies (This IS a zombie game, right?)- No supplies- When you do get a gun it's just before you're about to starve to death, and you're more likely to be smitten by god in all his fury than get ammo for it. There isn't anything to shoot at either- There is no merit in playing it, you can't even try to be the best player on the server because you are literally the only one- It's an hours run to get to anywhere (And you won't even find anything there most of the time)",1

2013,"This game, is actually pretty fun to play. I don't even know why, but most of the reviews on this game have been negative.Real boxing, is a game where you can fight realistic CPUs in career, in places like Las Vegas, New York, Moscow and many others to unlock! Or, you can fight your friends, or some randoms in online. Another reason why this game is suitable for boxing fans, is because its like the only Boxing game on PC, or Steam.This game also provides blood, and scars on the face as you punch giving more realism to the game, the game does have some flaws, but I really recommend this game, unless you care about every little thing, then I wouldn't recommend.",1

2013,"After clearing some space on my computer, I was able to play without terrible fps lag, 30 fps is the max I can get, and my computer meets the reccomended.First off I would like to say it is a good and fun game, its really realistic with a lot more better animations from 2K14, when they fall, try to get up, its just all smooth and like how it would be in real life.But one problem, besides fps lag, the custimization in this is quite bad, or even terrible. Its custimization feature is nothing compared to 2K14, it has 1 nice new feature, but that would basically be it. In 2K14 you have alot more custimizations available, more masks/clothing. You can edit the face more, more hair/facial hair.But anyways thats not what the game is about, so I think this game is actually pretty good besides those exceptions, just one more feature which I think they shouldve added is the arena music effect they used in 2K14. It made you feel like you were there with all the echos, but yeah thats basically it, I would rate this 7 and a half outta 10.",1

Yes.I can't tell you why this game was amazing and original and something so unique it has never been replicated.The best I can do is say the experience this game provides is worth more than I can say, buy it, I want my friends to buy it, I want everyone to play what is an amazing experience and if that doesn't sway you, hell i'll gift it.",1

2013,"I can't even be bothered highlighting the great points, yeah its a good game but its essentially a bad clone of Warhammer: Battle March. This game doesn't contain half of the playable races or units that Battle March did, the siege combat is actually worse than in BM and when playing as Chaos in BM you can actually destroy towns and buildings whilst battling armies in canon locations where as here you just beat the enemy army and ""pillage"" the town with a simple left click. The game is good but the fact that I can find better points in a game of the same universe from 8 years ago should give an indicator of its current state. Its a fun game and I enjoy the scope of the universe you play in, its also very true to the lore however, if you want to play a good Warhammer game play Battle March, if you're after a Total War game with Warhammer elements then, sure, pick up a copy but not for full price or maybe wait for the next 10 DLCs so you actually get a complete Warhammer game.Edit: $3 US To add blood lmao",1

Add enough hot sauce so the egg mixture is bright orange. In another bowl, combine the flour and pepper. Season the chicken with the house seasoning. Dip the seasoned chicken in the egg, and then coat well in the flour mixture.Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a deep pot. Do not fill the pot more than 1/2 full with oil.Fry the chicken in the oil until brown and crisp. Dark meat takes longer than white meat. It should take dark meat about 13 to 14 minutes, white meat around 8 to 10 minutes.House Seasoning:Mix ingredients together and store in an airtight container for up to 6 months.got this recipe from: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/southern-fried-chicken-recipe.htmlEnjoy",1

1999,"Ampersand is a game of impossible peaks and disappointing valleys. Its highs of movement, customization options, and just the city of Paris itself pierce the sky like the spire of Notre Dame. On a purely technical level, Unity is a marvel to walk through and admire. But at the same time, a lot of my journey through the French Revolution felt as cold and heartless as the darkest depths of the catacombs. I was never given a real reason to care about new Assassin Arno, or the events that transpired. Instead, I had to find my own fun throughout my 30 hours in Unity, which was generally easy to do in its large sandbox assassination scenarios. However, it’s a bit disappointing to see how few of the long-standing problems with the series have been solved by the upgrade to the new generation of gaming hardware.",1

2013,"A beautifully hand crafted game with a massive world and a massive story line that always keeps you interested and wanting more. The game's vast open world with quests and collectibles never feels dull or dead, along with an incredibly beautiful terrain rich with color and life, filled with scattered villages, bandit camps, caves, and powerful creatures. The game has many side quests, most of which will shape the world and the main story line depending on the choices that the player makes. The level of detail that is put into mere side quests is astonishing, with some taking the same amount of time as it would take to complete the main story line of a small-medium sized game. You'll find yourself wandering the world, completing quests yet you'll find that you've barely scraped the surface of the story that The Witcher 3 presents. The gameplay is polished and well-balanced, with fluid and exciting combat and an on-depth crafting and alchemy system.CD Projekt Red have excelled with The Witcher 3, creating the most incredible world I've experienced and a story that will get you hooked from the very beginning, along with incredible gameplay. The Witcher 3 sets a new, and incredibly high standard for both video games, and the RPG genre. This game could very well be the GOTY for 2015.Pros- Incredible visuals- Incredible and massive world- Engrossing story- Well-balanced and enjoyable combat- In-depth crafting systemsCons-None!10/10",1
2013,"I've been playing this game since it's release in December of 2014, so I've got quite a bit of time on it. Right off the bat I'll say that this game isn't for everyone. If you're expecting all out action all the time then prepare to be disappointed, as there is A LOT of simple and sometimes unexciting travelling. This game has many roles that can be played out by the player whether it be a bounty hunter, trader or a pirate. The game's learning curve is also fairly steep and you won't find yourself travelling the entire galaxy or completing every bounty within the first few hours if not days.All in all, it's a great, polished game with depth to its combat, customization, and economy systems. If you love space simulators or just space in general and you've got the patience needed to get around the massive world that E:D offers then this game is just right for you. But this game also has its fair share of issues. The quests become repetitive, dull, and boring. You'll find yourself doing the exact same thing over and over with the only change being the location and names of quest givers. Don't be put off if you find it difficult the first few hours as this game isn't very casual friendly but soon enough you'll know exactly what you're doing and start your journey in no time. This is space exploration at its finest.Note: a joystick is recommended for this game but not necessary.Pros- Massive world- In-depth combat, customization and trading system- Great Visuals- Various roles to choose fromCons- Steep learning curve- Repetitive quests9.5/10",1
2013,"Note: While I only have ~29 hours on the PC version, I've put in over 100 hours on a different platform. The long awaited and the missing piece of the Metal Gear Solid series is finally here, and it's a masterpiece. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, tells the story of Big Boss's descent into villainy and what makes him the character that we know from Metal Gear 1 and 2. Running on the Fox Engine, the game's visuals are great, and the gameplay and optimization are top notch, and from what I've played so far on the PC version, the game runs very well. The game is running on almost a constant 60fps (except during some heavy action moments) with my settings completely maxed out. Although one of my gripes with the PC version is when using the keyboard and mouse I've found that the iDroid can be frustrating to use as there is no mouse control in the menus. Other than that, the PC version of the game is near perfect. The gameplay aspect of the game is much better in almost every way compared to other games in the series and has now become open-world. The gameplay is very similar to Peace Walker, with a loadout menu allowing you to change your gear before every mission. The gun-play and controls are an improvement over past games too, with the weapon and item selection chosen using a wheel display, and sub-sections. But within all these new additions to the game, you'll find the classic Metal Gear gameplay that you're used to, from the CQC-interrogations, to using a cardboard box to sneak past enemies and aiming for 'S' ranking missions. The game introduces ""buddies"", buddies can assist you during operations in the field: D-Horse gives you a faster means of travel, D-Dog can be used you distract enemies, scout enemies, plants or animals, and even kill. There's also Quiet, a story-based character that is completely optional, and can assist  in missions as a sniper, to either kill or tranquilize enemies from afar. And finally, there's D-Walker; D-Walker can do almost everything that the player can do on foot. You can fire a weapon, sneak around enemies, or even CQC them, and it can also be used a means of travel if you prefer it over using D-Horse. Another ""new"" addition to The Phantom Pain is Mother Base. Mother Base is the home of Diamond Dogs, and just like in Peace Walker, it can be used to develop weapons and items for the player to use in-game. But unlike in Peace Walker, in The Phantom Pain the player can walk around Mother Base and interact with their soldiers that they recruit on the battlefield.From the eighty hours that I've played, there are no issues in the gameplay that stand out and overall, it's the best of the series.But of course, Metal Gear games aren't all about the gameplay, the captivating yet sometimes confusing story also plays a huge role in the appeal of the games. The Phantom Pain tells the story of Big Boss's descent into villainy and is the missing piece of the gap between Peace Walker and Metal Gear. But the way the game tells the story is what's important, and is an issue in this case. The long cutscenes that can last for several minutes that fans of the series have come to know and love are missing this time around, instead, replaced with cassette tapes that fill the player in on the details of a situation or event that has occured in the story/cutscene. This can leave the players wanting more, as the cinematography in the series is known to be exceptional, but instead they are left to listen to dozens of tapes. While this doesn't necessarily affect the overall story, it does affect the flow of the plot, in my opinion. New-comers to the series don't need to be worried about not understanding what's going on too, as the events leading up to The Phantom Pain are explained in the tapes. Another issue with the story is that it can leave the players dissatified in the end, but that's something I won't go into as it will contain spoilers. But overall, Hideo Kojima has outdone himself yet again, and has created yet another masterpiece of a game. If this really is his last Metal Gear game then he has ended the series with a bang, and one that any player whether they are a veteran of the series or a new-comer, can enjoy.Pros:-A Hideo Kojima Game-Incredible gameplay-Great visuals-Well optimized-Immense level of detailCons:-Story/Ending may be unsatisfactory to some10/10",1
2013,its great that its on pc and i highly suggest getting the game. its awesome,2
2013,One of my favorite fps's of all time. . . some strategy involved that seperates it from COD,2
2013,Bom pkrl,1
2013,This game is the best around. Nothing is ever going to bring this game down.Ever.Never Ever.It's good.Get it.,1
2013,"This is possibly my favourite game. Ever.I absolutely recommend this game to any one who enjoys any rogue-like games, Has a fettish for weather or loves to stack different and awesome items and become a beast. Don't forget artifacts, those are cool.Also, this game has good strats such as Boar Beach.Get. this. game.That is all.",1
2013,Chicken loves her sword.,1
2013,"Great game, I played the demo for atleast 5 hours.It has great music (But sometimes it does get kind of repetetive) And the gameplay is smooth. I am really looking forward to the next update! The only thing i would say that is wrong is that in the patch im playing, Pressing T Will spawn a boxing glove to the mouse location allowing unlimited gloves and everytime a glove is fired it will do 2000+ damage. Although i know this will get patched, It's fun while it lasted.Definately pick this up if you are into rogue-likes.",1
2013,"A great game, loads of fun, best to play with a group of friends. 200+ hours for sure.",2
2013,"This mod/game will require many of valve's games for a good experience. In saying that, there are many things you can still do without many valve games. The lack of objectives (apart from achievements) makes this game a unoque sandbox. Schnazzy",1
2013,"Portal 2 is an extremely enjoyable game using an interesting setting, fun mechanics, fantastic level design and witty writing to convey an unforgettable experience. My only complaint is that the puzzles only really start getting difficult towards the end of the game but other than that, I would very highly recommend this amazing game.",1
2013,"Terraria is an indie game similar to minecraft but a lot larger and complex. Terraria is set in a 2 dimensional world with many creatures that want to kill you. The only real objective in this game is to survive; you start with some basic tools and a guide but the rest is up to you. Terraria uses a retro pixelated look that gives the game that simple feel. There are many weapons and potions you will encounter to assist you on you journey, and with the prefix system, this creates a huge variety in the weapons. Terraria has a multiplayer option. Setting up a multiplayer server is an unreasonably lengthy process, of installing the server.exe and hamachi, making sure everyone is on the hamachi network etc. Terraria is a great survival game with a lot of playtime and content. 86/100",1
2013,"Borderlands 2 is the sequel to the 2009 game Borderlands, it continues the story of another vault opening in pandora and more vault hunters trying to retrieve its goods. You play as either an assassin, a siren, a gunzerker, or a commando, unless you are willing to pay more to unlock the mechromancer and psycho. Borderlands 2 has guns, a lot of guns. There are literally (almost) infinite types of different guns; the game uses a complex algorithm to produce many different guns, inserting different prefixes and stats each time. This game is well designed with stunning comic book style graphics. I would definitely recommend this to anyone fond of the action-adventure fps sub-genre. 92/100",1
2013,Need I say more?,1

2013,"Great game, love the graphics :D",1
2013,"I really like this game, It has alot of things to do and create and id recommend you go play ;D",1
2013,Fun to play for hours as it's very addicting to play the different game modes and arena's. Levelling up and getting all the garage parts is also a different aspect of the game to enjoy. Love the new hoops mode!,1
2013,"Fun little game to play, love blowing up the opponent!",1
2013,"*Spoiler Alert*It was good gameplay, but I felt that the level design didn't really allow me any breaks. It was actually 3 big levels, with heaps of miniature missions in between.However, THE ENDING WAS HOPELESS! And I say again, *Spoiler Alert* if you are going to kill off one of the main characters, you can't mix it with the other ""Ready for another mission"" ending. You need to keep them separate, and this game didn't do that.But I guess that once you get over the ending you will look back at how fun the gameplay was.",2
2013,"This game has no point whatsoever, and that is what makes it fun. It is the perfect game to just muck around with friends on. It's currently only in beta, and if they make online multiplayer for it then that would be amazing. Still, you can play locally. I hooked up 3 controllers to a PC and played Starwhal and had a great time. Cool game.",2
2013,Overall Content = very good. So glad they kept the blacksmith because that was my favourite part of Lego LOTR.I don't like how full-screen isn't allowed but that is a minor detail. Great game!,2
2013,"The best Lego Game yet!The suit changer added in is something I've waited for since Lego Batman 1, and it is as good as i imagined.They have also gone back to the old method of putting the red bricks in the hubs. This brings back nostalgic memories and it is good to get back to your rootsAs for the gameplay, it retains that high quality, especially in combat.1 slight glitch involved the minikit detector not finding the minikit but minor detail.The hubs are good, shame they are not full-open-world but close enough. The teleportation system works wellThe characters are well balanced, as are the abilities (except Cyborg, he is so OP in late-game) and the DLCs are fantastic!Must buy!",2
2013,yolo,1
2013,Super bueno el juego :D (no respondo si te dan ataques de epilepticos por jugarlo...),2
2013,I would highly recommend this game because of 4 factors-Addons(mods)-Multiplayer-Possibilities -A lifetime of funThis game is very fun and the community is great as i said before i would highly recommend g-mod because of it's outstanding gameplay and physics,0
2013,"I would hate to see anyone waste $10 dollers on a bad game like this so heres 3 words i will give you about this games ""absolutly freaking terrible""",0
2013,This game allows me to not go outside and socialize with people anymore.10/10 would bang again,1
2013,"Tomb Raider 2013 was a great success and highly lives up to it's name with it's inovative mechinics, Inspiring soundtrack and emotional story.The mechinics of Tomb Raider are not just inovative in the sense of adding something new to the game but are inovative that the players can really use them to help them on their journey through the untold and mysterious legends and mysterys that surround the unusual island that you are trapped on. For example the ajustibillty of the bows equipment like the rope allowing you to glide around specific parts of the map and the mechanical pulley which you're rewarded with after completing a specific part of the game that allows you to travel even faster giving you the sense that you are in more control of the situation you are in on the island. I really enjoyed using the equipment for traveling through the map and for a more tactical way of dealing with your foes.The story of Tombraider draws you in and leaves you confused (In a good way, at first) as you start to put the peices of the mystery together. Tombraider slightly over exhagerates the emotions of Laracroft but they still made you feel her emotions and help you to see the changes in her as she progresses through the story. She starts in her adventure with the determination of uncovering the legend of the Sun Queen. As lara is faced with the challenges of the story like having to kill her first person or losing an important friend she is able to carry on with resilience and the determination she starts the story with. The story makes it feel like your discovering the mystery rather than your playing a character who is and is rewarding when you start to make sense of everything. I really enjoyed the story even if it was slightly shorter than I would of liked.The music if amazing and really compliments the emotions and scences in the game. Tomb raiders has a memorable sound track that is inspiring and compliments Lara's strength and determination in the story. The main theme song with Its suttle piano notes builds up the suspense and invigorates combat. I have even downloaded this song as it is an amazing instrumental.Overall this game was well worth the price I got it for ( $8.99 usd) and is worth alot more than that. It has some mistakes as any game but the don't bring my amazment of this inspirational game down. I highly recommend for an escape to another world or adventure and I cannot wait for the next game in the series.",1
2013,"Amazingly addictive! I recommend this gane, brings back memories, it may look weird but don't judge a book by its cover!",0
2013,As if you've never wanted to be a goat ...This is one of those games where glitches are the best part and it is bloody well done!There is really nothing to say about the game except - GET IT! It is totally worth the $9.99 - its probably the best buy I've had in a while.What are you waiting for? BUY THIS GAME!,1
2013,"""We shall not introduce microtranactions.""A couple of years later;""Welcome to Pay2Day Global Offensive""And it's not just cosmetic, It's stat related too. I love Payday, it's a great game, yet this is a huge mistake Overkill. At least CSGO did it right, you didn't",2

2013,"Quite possibly one of the best WWII games I have ever played! Although it is daunting and confusing at first, you will become used to it overtime. The game is very polished when it comes to realism with my personal favourite being the tanks. Overall a 9/10, missing out on the the full score because you can't fly planes :(",1

2013,A must buy for all fps lovers. The devs work hand in hand to deliver such an enjoying game.Meant to be played with fun people.,1
2013,"A game such as this requires a ton of patience and a love management. In all honesty, this game has a lot that has it going for it such as its story, art and uniqueness as a game. The story was pretty interesting, where you play as Sgt. Burden working to save the world. The pixel art style was a very nice touch to the game, I couldn't think of an art style more fitting for GWBW. Lastly making decisions that could ultimately make you die or survive keep the game quite fun. Nonetheless, like most games, it has its flaws. The lack of a quicksave option is one. Another is the replayability because you play GWBW for its story and/or gameplay. Pros:- nice pixel art style- interesting story- unique gameplay- has a nice pace, the story isn't too long or short- the game is overall well made- no bugs (for me)Cons:- no quicksave- cannot be replayable (atleast to me)- minor things such as characters sometimes placed too close to each other.Definitely a must play!I'd give it a 8/10",1

Haven't really come across too many bugs, which is awesome. I'd recommend this game if you enjoy tactical team based shooters, and whats there to loose? It's free!!",2
2013,"So far, I have had a heap of fun with this game, and it is also extremely creepy. One minute you are setting up your shelter, the next you are fighting for your survival against tribal mutants. Yes there are a few bugs, but it's early access. The most annoying one however is that after you save your game, a lot of your loot disappears, apart from that they are only minor. I'd definitely recommend getting this game, it's fun, it's cheap and the price will most likely be risen later on :)",2
2013,"Great gam, full of action and fun! Better doing it with people you know",2
2013,"Just started playing the game, and I'm loving it so far. Graphics aren't the best...but I really enjoy the gameplay. If you're into zombie survival genres, I would definitely recommend this (especially when its on sale).There are a few negative things about the game though - Firstly some of the animations look pretty bad (including sliding down ladders, combat) and the controls take a little getting used to. But overall, it's different to other zombie games - having to look after and care for a survivng community, and driving from place to place stocking up on supplies. I'd give it a 8/10",2
2013,"Heard a lot about this game and have been waiting for a sale.This game is well worth the sale money if you're looking for a realistic, tactical shooter. Gameplay is excellent, sounds are great, only negative I can see are the graphics, but it's decent for source engine.",2

2012,"Half-life 2 is a big game so I'm not going to review episode 1 and 2 in seperate reviews. Lets keep this simple. Anyways, Half-life 2 is said to be ""the best game ever for PC"" by some people but I really have mixed feelings about the source engine (half-lifes game engine). Dont get me wrong the source engine is great because it holds games like Fistfull of Frags and other indie games along with valves famous Team Fortress 2.. So hopefully you're on the same page as me, what I'm trying to say is HL2 doesn't apeal to me on the source engine here is why: the console gives access to cheats wich really is tempting, the game gives me a headache because each puzzle in a chapter is made by over 30 MAPS! (A lot of loading) and the puzzle physics get very annoying because lets just say this game may be dated from 2006 but I have seen better that released BEFORE HL2.But lets get serious... this is valve's main game give it a try. JUST BECAUSE I DONT LIKE IT DOES NOT MEAN YOU WONT EITHER. 7/10 Maybe someday I'll buy the third one and go through hl2.",2
2012,Never buy this on 360. THE ABSOLUTE BEST THING ABOUT THIS GAME IS THE MODS. And second of all this is a valve game so buy it.,2

2012,"Hey remember that one shooter that was fun but wasnt really the best.. No? of course you dont that is because there really never was a Planetside 1.. well if there is and I just dont know of it that is probably because people just dont speak of it... So Im gunna go ahead and review Planetside 2 like this. Imagine that one really fun game you played with your friends on Teamfortress except 10 TIMES THE GRAPHICS, THE PEOPLE, AND THE CHAOS. Yeah thats right you cant go walking in this game without being beheaded within like a minute! Because all the tryhard Infiltrators (definitely not me... ok fine me) are there ready for you but what is really funny is somehow NONE OF THIS ruins the experience, after many updates and I guess just growth of the game it has changed into a really popular faction based shooter that a lot of people play. Heil Terran. 9/10",2
2012,"No No No No No No No. Last year I spent 60 dollars worth of steam cash on this bad egg to the series and regret it. BATMAN'S ROCKSTEADY GAME SERIES IS AWESOME OK BUT ARKHAM ORIGINS (the third one) IS MADE MAINLY BY WB. Not only this but the traveling is strictly limited to on food or gliding wich to be honest makes you ""Fall with style"" not glide.But this does not mean the previous games were bad. 6/10 maybe I will give number 4 a try",2
2012,"Metal gear games have amazing graphics,fighting styles, and best of all cutscenes. The cutscenes in metal gear (any metal gear game) are astounding and feel like a movie. Now obviously thats not why its good, the main reason is the fact that you play 7 lengthy missions as Raiden a bonafied, samurai, cyborg and you fight all kinds of bosses from a girl with 6 8 hands to a giant UG (Play MG to know what UG's are)",2

2012,"Warframe is game that makes other FPS look inferior, it's supposedly set in the future, where Tenno Soldiers fight Grineer Marines, for absolutely no unkown reason ; possibly the soverignity of the solar system.The game is also supported by microtransactions via steam. DLC from the game is ridiculous, the more you pay, the more stronger and better you are, but unless you actually put in time and effort to get the same results as the p2winners.Overall, Warframe can be naturally seen as a fps and p2w game, this game actually seemed more new, unlike the other modern-day fps like black ops. Although the game can be seen as a p2w, rarely any time and effort needs to be put in to acquire better eqiupment since materials for blueprints are fairly easy to get.I rate this 7/10 or 70%",1

2012,"Maplestory. This game is by far the worst game ever created. The Characters are sh*t, The Animations for skills suck, The story lines are lame. How bad can one game be? The Story of an average mapler. One day a person randomly overhears some of his friends talking about maplestory. He gets curious so he finds out what it is and downloads the game. He starts to play the game, it isn't too bad, he makes friends, he has fun. - Few months later. The person gets addicted to the game and is ""mapling"" 24/7. He also spends $10 - $50 everyday for the Nexon's in-game currency known as ""Nexon Cash"" or ""NX""After a while his friends disappear, and makes new friends and they disappear too.HE does this for 5 years until one day he looks at the game properly and thinks to himself. ""What have I done during the past 5 years?"" He then proceeds to view his purchase history, his characters, his life.What has happened during the past 5 years you may ask? Well. This person wasted his money, his time, his relationships and most of all his LIFE. It is far too hard to comeback from maplestory if you played it for such a long time, and when you do, I'll tell you, you will never look at the game the first time you looked at it. How ""innocent"" it is, How ""fun"" it is. The only exception you can see to is that you have friends whom play the game. Other than that I suggest you drop it.",1

2012,Really really fun especially how most things are destructable and driviable. I really enjoy the freedom of it although at times it can be a bit repedative.,1
2012,Great game especially since there is a mixture between old and new. Because you have old samurai and archers against new line infantry with rifles. Great contrast very realistic i highly recommend this game especially since you can go into first person view.,1

2012,"This game is amazing I really enjoy the partial open world. Also the bullet ballistics I find are a lot better then Sniper Elite V2. Another great feature of this game is the new X-ray shots as they now incorporate muscles, circulatory system and new BALL PHYSICS! and the graphics on the x-ray shots are just sooooo much better. In a way there is more to choose from when you shoot someone. They also have added X-ray shots on vehicles so thats really awesome exploding vehicles. There is now new weapon customization and new weapons like the Italian Carcano rifle and the German panzershreck. And new enemies not Germans and Russians but now again Germans and Italians, in a way i liek that as the Italians aren't really recognised much in WWII. But this game is just legendary I definately recommend this game especially with the Hunt the Grey Wolf DLC it's really good. I give this game a rating of 8/10 ",1

2012,it's good though if your not an alien or predator fan than it might get boring.the alien missions are pretty good. the stealth is nice but don't try to melee fight with the alien because it sucks ♥♥♥.Marine is a generic shooter though it can be fun making the alien's heads explode.Predator idk didn't finish it because I got bored.The graphics are alright. the finishing animations are nice but something seems off with some of them and they take way too long sometimes. Multiplayer seems dead with the exception of probably 1 server thats on at night (usually american servers though)I wouldn't bother getting the dlc,1

2012,"YES!!!! This is brilliant. The art style is beatiful, the gameplay is great... and it's still in beta. There are some glitches every now and then, but they aren't really disruptive to the actual gameplay. You can create your own systems and set up  your own lobbies across multiple gamemodes. It runs smoothly on the best settings but I have a fairly good machine. Haven't played many games yet but it is one of my favourite games already. BUY IT!!!!",2

2012,"Counter Strike is a classic game. Fun, addictive, and customizable. It's incredibly easy to mod, texture and map for so you could expect a whole lotta mods. Pros:-Great gameplay, bit of a learning curve but it'll become second instinct soon enough-Servers are still up, even for such an old game it still has a whole crap-ton of servers. -Modding community is GREAT-Cheap, as in really freakin cheap, not indie game cheap, but still very cheapCons-Most people who you will play with have been playing for longer than I have been alive. Expect to get pwned very very often-Netcode is a ♥♥♥♥♥, adjusting settings using the console takes a hell of a while-People are sometimes way too serious when playing-For Graphics junkies: Graphics are pretty damn old-looking (what the hell do you expect it's GoldSrc)While it's not a perfect game it still provided me with tons of fun and I love playing it. It's a bit slower than CSGO and the weapons behave differently. Conclusion: If you want a nice classic shooter that's light on the pocket and the computer then this along with Half-Life should be in your library",1
2012,STALKER is an game that just sucks you inI honestly almost crap my pants every time the grass rustles. The wind and music just make you feel like you're walking in a place of despair. The campfire and guitar tracks make you relax. Bandits utter Russian swears as they chuck nades and try to kill you with AKMs and all sorts of guns. It's also pretty hard if you're not used to it like I am. Thanks to the immersion I constantly forget to save. 10/10 buy this game or GET OUT OF HERE STALKER,1
2012,"I was a once a young lad in the year 2012. Team Fortress 2 was getting a bit old and I was wanting for a pseudo-tactical experience. Ruling out Battlefield 3 and Call of Duty I called to mind an old title that has been sitting in my mind for years, ever since the 3rd grade ""Counter Strike"". I then went to the store, found the package for CSGO and bought it. I started it up, went onto a DM server, walked a few meters and got AWP'd. Ever since then things have changed. Some for the better and some for worsethis game can be summarized with 3SSkillSkinsSuffering (when you're just starting)A warning though, CSGO isn't easily played on a toastermine is a laptop with an i5 2.4 ghz, Nvidia GT 310m, and 4GB ram, on all lowest settings and with a few launch options (-high -nojoy -no3d9ex...etc) and a console command (cl_forcepreload 1) I get a 70-100 frames, 90 frames average on Dust 2Buy this game, even if it's not on sale, and have funP.S. don't get sucked in by the skins and stuff, they won't affect gameplay and if anything make you easier to spot",1
2012,"While I haven't played this game in a while I can say that the few hours I've played this have been nail-bitingly, ♥♥♥-kickingly fun. Nazi Zombies ain't got nothing on this as the atmosphere of the maps coupled with a pseudo-realistic depiction of a zombie outbreak makes this a very fun game. Not your typical Zombie Bandwagon shooter, 10/10",1
2012,"So after my first 30 minutes of this game I must conclude that it is fantasticThis is the first ""old"" shooter I played and it makes me want to play all of them. Even with outdated graphics this game gives you an adrenaline rush as intense as that one time your parents almost caught you wanking. Graphics: OLDseriously old looking graphics. The unique thing is the render distance. Most FPS games are corridor-crawlers, not this one. In Serious Sam you wander open fields full of dangerous foes. Controls: mehI've seen quite a few better controls. They feel a bit weird when you first jump in so I thought I'd get used to them. Then it turns out mouse accel was on and I'm a bloody idiot. So yeah I recommend adjusting the options before jumping into the game.Gameplay: AWESOMEThe most important part, and it is amazing. Nothing to me is more relaxing than wading through the blood and gore of several enemies to reach ammo and healthpacks. It feels like an 80's action film in which you are the main character, and it feels good.Enemies: breddy gudNo lack of variety here. I've seen so many different kinds and as of now I only played 30 minutes.Overall: I'd give it an 8/10. pretty good go buy it ",1
2012,"Look to be honest I haven't played to much of the game to confirm my point, but everything I have played has been a blast and I highly reccomend anyone who wants a cheap action game. The combat system may not be the best but heck you get to blow stuff up, isn't that all you need. Some story missions may be a liitle boring but there are some moments you go, okay that was pretty cool. An example of this is when using the OP as hell minigun to take down enemies and to destroy walls to get you and a partner out of the area. Just Cause contains a slightly hard to get driving system which can be frustrating in side missions as you can constantly find yourself flying into a wall or losing control and crashing into another car... or two, or sometimes three. However Just Cause 2 makes up for this with awesome air veichles for quick transportation around the vast endless seeming map. With a definitely affordable price so far I think Just Cause 2 is a must buy on the PC.",1
2012,"Great Game, and cannot wait for full official release. I recomend it if you are prepared for a lot of bugs and glitches, and the occasional restart and reboot of your computer. Graphics are okay, but it is an awesome game, and great value.",1
2012,"I have played a decent amount to get the grasps of the game, and at last I can play a graphiaclly amazing looking game and it packs a huge challenge with it.

2012,"Muito bom boa jogabilidade e bons graficos, porem antes de lançarem o jogo diseram que o modo Day Z viria junto com jogo, então comprei o jogo esperando que tivesse o modo Day Z porem não, pensei que com o tempo aplicariam o modo, mais até hoje não foi lançado, e procuro saber mais sobre informaçoes do modo de jogo e se sera lançado ou não. Tento me contentar com os mods mais sempre quis ver o que os criadores do Arma fariam com o mod aplicado na versão passada.",1
2012,"I believe that this game was amazing! although it took a while to work out how to do certain things and that a certain level was realy grueling and took a while to finish (level 11: mountains) the combat was great! the graphics were like an amazing drawing that was gone over so many times that it was perfect, like staring at hours worth of perfection in an artform. The story was told through pictures in scenes before and after every level meaning that many players will interpret the story differently. The music was great and there where various enemies making it a great experience, barely ever repeting desighn or level. This game was amazing and one of the greatest indie games i have ever played (not realy a large advertised game but a smallish game) sometimes indies can truely be better than big launch titles, this game is a perfect example of one. Just a tip if: if you find any levels realy hard (such as 11) take it slow and dont rush, if you do you will probably get killed in a lange hored of enemies, if any level is extremely hard you should probably change your difficulty down if you are new to the game. Another probably more important thing is to take your time to explore as you will find many useful secrets and amazing hidden things in the beutiful levels. I beleive this game is amazing and worth your money! just one question, is the game hand drawn like rayman origins? becaus the environments and creatures look amazing like they have had a lot of time put into them.",1
2012,"this game is great, it has heaps to do and after almost 130 hours worth of play i have beaten every boss, beaten every event enemy and event boss at least 3 times, collected every rare pet summoning item, kiled at least 2 of every enemy and moved in every npc,there is so much to do in this game, collecting rare pet items (i have all of them and i have the collectors edition so i get the carrot) of which the seaweed that summons the turtle is my favourite, fighting bosses (the twins or the ice queen would have to be the hardest) making potions, building awesome buildings (i have 2 halloween themed buildings a pumpkin one and a spooky wood one) lots of biomes including the corruption or crimson (you spawn with either one crimson supposedly being rarer) ocean, hallow, snow, desert, normal, floating islands, the living woods, the realy rare spider nests and crimson/corruption versions of the desert, snow and hallowed versions of them to. this game is amazing and out of all of my hours i have only spent about 3 on multiplayer or other worlds the world is so deep and goes down for ages, the one and only down side to this game is that i would want to be able to have a bigger world, not deeper but wider as i have never experienced a hallowed, corrupt or crimson snow biome or hallowed desert. over all i give this game 9.8 out of 10, it would get a ten if you could choose to have a bigger world. i cant wait for the next event or boss as i have experienced every challenge and i am hungry for more. this game is amazing, next i will move on to dont starve as it looks like a challengeand for all of those KIDS with NO LIFE who are like ""this game sucks! play minecraft! i just wet my pants while playing minecraft!"" just no, ohnestly this game has way more features minecraft has what   5 tiers of weapons? and no prefixes? this game has about a hundred tiers for swords, from wood to terra and minecraft has 5 normal enemies, 3 nether enemies and 2 slimes, thats only ten, i mean seriously? in normal mode alone terraria has around 40 enemies then when you progress to hardmode about 100 and i have counted the bosses,  about 2in minecraft and 14 in terraria (4 in normal, 5 in hardmode and 5 in events). so just dont complain",1
2012,"Dear Esther is an amazing game based on your character and a mysterious island, you are a dying explorer writing letters to esther an entity so far unknown to you, is the island real or just a hallucination? who is esther? it is reaveled as you play, you have nothing but memories of a fatal car crash and fragmented memories the previous people who lived on the island, you where rowing to a land you only know as ""the mainland"" to escape a disease you only know as ""the infection"" and as your charachter explains in the first chapter you have washed up on ""this wretched island"" and you learn of other things like seeing jets fly over the island and you eventualy learn what actualy happened (im tempted to spoil it but i wont).The story and the music are butifull but in the first chapter it feels realy creepy being truly alone, but it gets better with the amazing veiws of the island (and getting used to being alone) all your character wants is to escape and to ""become a gull and soar over the island and be free"" you learn of people carving white markings into the cliff when they are dying to warn others to keep away untill whatever killed them has died too...I beleive that this game is amazing, both beutiful and eerie and i give it a 9 out of 10 it was an amazing experience, worth your money and worth playing twice.",1
2012,"This game is not just tower defense, it is also a huge rpg with loads of dlc all worth the money you pay! (even though i got it in a humble bundle a while ago that came with ALL dlc for only like 20 cents, but since then the tinkerers lab dlc came out which is the only one i dont have but i still have the series EV and REALY want it.) This game IS the best tower defense i have ever played and one of the best rpgs aswel! I beleive this game has great multiplayer where you can all play together and have HOURS of fun, its worth encouraging your friends or family to buy or even buying a copy for them! This game is amazing with loads of different enemies and maps, complete with randomly generated and dropped for you to pick up. Great game 10 out of 10",1
2012,"This game is great 10/10i played through the story and got the normaland the good ending (i didnt get the good ending achievement for some reason?) and then i realised you could get a bad ending aswell. If you can follow it the games story is actualy pretty good and to be ohnest when i finished the good ending i was sad, i want to play more of this game (hopefully a sequel) and see what happened after the ending, and there are so many secrets in this game! you can get a bubble gun which i went back to get and a ray gun or a snake gun (the ray gun is better) its amazing that i missed out on the secret giant rabbid bunny statue and the air fortress thing (the one where you get to fight all of those clones of curly and an extra boss) and the bottom of the floating island and a few other areas where i would have been able to find more items or rocket upgrades and im annoyed that i missed them. This game is ohnestly a masterpiece.",1
2012,"Got this game with the fallout anthology (would recommend buying the bundle) this game is a bit hard to get into in the beginning, if you watch a video of the gameplay before you play the combat system looks very complicated, but honestly its not, five minutes of messing around staining the cavern walls of the starting area with the blood of your enemies (little innocent rats that do like 1 damage when they try to defend themselves from your skull crushing boots) and you will have just about everything combat/AP-related down pat. The game is actually pretty fun when you get into it, its pretty rewarding too.Now I would usually leave tips for character creation up to people to find out but i do have 1 very important tip to write.speech is important but CHARISMA IS UTTERLY USELESS, I seriously recommed not having any more than 1-2 points in charisma, speech alone is enough, it sort of seems like charisma doesnt even affect speech in-game. Use the extra points for luck, intelligence or agility. (you really should start with around 9 agility, you can get an operation later in the game to increase it to 10, ability points are the most important thing in combat).for its time: 9.5/10for todays time: 8.5/10",1
2012,"This is the largest most extensive old school RPG I have ever played, I have played moost of the fallout series (fallout 3 and NV on ps3) and decided to revisit them by buying the anthology (if you dont already have the games on PC i would recommend buying it). I have already finished fallout 1, that game was great, but this... this game is something amazing in comparison. There is a lot to do, and unlike the first game there is no real time limit that i know of, you are able to complete all quests that you want to without the worry of screwing it up and having to start over.Pros:+ combat that is fun, actually pretty easy to get around (it may seem complex if you watch gameplay)+ very big world+ level cap at 99, alowing you to get just about every perk that you reall want (unllike the first game, capping at 21)+ alot of diverse different types of weapons and iterms (unlike the basic 10mm pistol, chinese pistol etc that are in the later games)+ there is alot of stuff to do, things to kill, loot to find and quests to complete+ lots of interesting lore and backstory+ this game is honestly fun to playCons- sequencing can be VERY annoying when fighting enemies and just waiting for your turn- early on random encounters can be annoying and way to difficult, sometimes i would go through a zone where random encounters would happen after every second of traveling, this is really irritating if you don't have a high outdoorsman skill, having to save before travel and save constantly while travelling from point A to point B.-occasional high amounts of lag, the only way to stop it is to save, exit the entire game and load which is very irritating and wastes alot of time.overall the pros outweigh the cons, so I rate this game 9/10, if you are interested in old style games or just want to experience the early fallout games I would highly recommend this game.",1
2012,This was a great game. I am surprised at how much I enjoyed this and how attached I became to the characters. I felt as if I was in some 3 hour long biographical film while I was playing. The game was absolutely wonderful. 8/10.,2

But remember to savour the times of being a beautiful star, because eventually, you'll just grow old, become a blackhole that can eat baby blackholes and guess what happens. You eat everything.",1
2012,"In this game, you can be all three classes!1) An old dancy man. 2) A squirrel woman.3) A fat ♥♥♥ with a beer belly. But overall, it is really fun. :) Lots of laughing when you play with a friend :)",1
2012,"When my boyfriend first got it, I said, ""Really? A game with cars and sports crossed over? That's so stupid, such a typical boys' game.""This comment was quickly taken back after I watched Mr.Fruits' videos on it and desperately wanting to try it for myself. Without even trying my bf's game, he soon bought it for me.24 hrs later, I have spent a quarter of that time playing Rocket League. So, do I like it?Well, as Flo Rida once sang, ""I don't like it, I love it.""",1

2012,"I loved Batman: Arkham Asylum so much that I was kind of afraid of Batman: Arkham City. I worried that the stars wouldn't align to produce a game as good as the original, or that the game would just recycle the original without offering us anything new or surprising. I'm happy to say I was wrong on both counts. Batman: Arkham City is not only as good as the original - it's also not the same game.",1

2012,"When I finished L.A. Noire's main storyline, I felt emotional. It was unacceptable for me when it ended, the game felt so perfect, so fresh and new, so unique. L.A. Noire is another FEEL TRIP type of game, a good one, its a game where it bested some legitimately good hollywood movies -- yes, it feels like your in a movie, its like a movie-game hybrid. The story is ♥♥♥♥♥♥IC, the gameplay is GTA mashed with CHRISTIAN VALUES, sounds and graphics are GOOD, people can RELATE to the characters + the characters are strong. The game is going to be an UNFORGETTABLE FEEL TRIP.9.5/10 would feel emotional again.",2
2012,"Batman: Arkham City is overwhelmingly great and atmospheric, everything in this game is great, more than great. The graphics, the sound effects and especially the music, the gameplay, and the storyline. Arkham City is one of the best games ever.  For me the thing that made Arkham City beautiful the most is its storyline and combat system.  The story has dozens of surprises, easter eggs for example, dozens of them that has connections with the main story, the sidequests and collectibles (riddler trophies unlockables like interview tapes) supports the main story giving the player background and an idea about key characters in the game. The game has a complete feeling when you finish it, the story isn't vague, not confusing, has few flaws, the storyline is nearly perfect. Plus the history of Arkham Asylum gives the game more background.BTW, I played the game for more than 80 hours, Steam didn't record my playtime when I'm offline.Still, Poison Ivy and Catwoman are so hot.9.8 + .2 for Catwoman's sexy a$$.10/10 would like to see Poison Ivy's vines all around Catwoman again",2
2012,"Don't be fooled by my playtime, I didn't play for 50.4 hours, I played Hitman: Absolution for almost 95 hours (Steam didn't record my offline time), the game's stealth is pretty good, the gameplay is great. You might be wondering how I got  90 hours of gameplay, well the thing is there are multiple ways of assassinating the targets, there are many possibilities of how you execute your targets from going in loud and dumb to going in undetected like a ghost. The story is okay, felt pretty plain to me, the story lacked something unique/unforgettable, but ITS OKAY. The stealth is GOOD. Gameplay is GOOD. Sounds and graphics are GREAT. Agent 47 is a BADASS. It is REPLAYABLE.I'd rate it a 7.5/10.",2
2012,Pretty sure I saw some testicles in this game,2
2012,"Call of Juarez: Gunslinger is one hell of a ROLLERCOASTER RIDE, the game is some INTENSE action piece of good wonderful piece of sh!t. Its UNIQUE, its a cowboy version of that sh!t game COD, its BETTER than COD, heck COD can go suck Juarez's cactus balls. Well, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger may have LACKED multiplayer and co-op but its still more ENJOYABLE than most FPS. The story is like a CLINT EASTWOOD themed ROLLERCOASTER with a narrator, packed with so much action, the graphics are COMIC style (is pretty good to look at, especially when you're at those mountain levels with orange trees and sh!t) in other words, the map environment is SO GOOD. The big downfall of Call of Juarez: Gunslinger was its brevity + it aint replayable, BUT its worth trying.7.5/10 would dodge bullets like Spider-Man again",2
2012,"Sleeping Dogs is a good game, it has so much content to offer(eating noodles, doing martial arts, street races, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on toilets, dating women, kicking demon balls) its like a more SANE version of Saints Row III, an ASIAN version of GTA IV, and a BETTER game than that piece of ♥♥♥♥ Watch Dogs. Sleeping Dogs is a LEGITIMATE game, its GOOD, the storyline is WELL WRITEN, its pretty EMOTIONAL, and ATMOSPHERIC at the end part, its WORTH playing. Well, I did ENJOY playing it, the story is a roller coaster ride, so many ups and down, there are so many FEELS in this game too, that I nearly sweat my eyes -- I'm being serious. BUT it couldve been so much more, it had potential to be one of those NEARLY ""almost-perfect game"", but it missed something crucial, it feels like the developers could've add something to make it more beautiful. STILL, its a LEGIT game. play it.7.8/10 would become asian again",2
2012,"Great horror game, it has been a long time since I have played a good horror game and not only is Outlast a horror gme, it is also a intense survival game. The sound effects and voice acting are great, the graphics are good and when you use night-vision, the game looks more realistic, the night-vision adds atmosphere to the game and the great music builds tension, also adds more atmosphere to the game. The storyline of Outlast is OK, its atmospheric, but it would be better if you played the DLC (Whistleblower) after finishing Outlast.",2

2012,reccommend if you have a good internet connection and good temperI live in Australia and because I play at odd times I tend to see the same people quite often. late at night it seems there are some people who use smurf accounts and just aim to get teammates banned. I am now on a one week cooldown because of 2 disconnects one because it's Australia and the other was a dc followed by a forced update the other two bans come from a group of two smurfs who get a bunch of kills and then try their hardest to get killed (jumping in front of awps and standing in molotovs ect.) I have no real way of doing anything to stop them and I can't leave either. the other thing that I noticed was people farming up smurf accounts by getting a bunch of kills and carrying for the first five or six rounds and then turning an auto spin on and going afk. The vote system should change from needing all but one in team to needing a majority and autospinning should be detected. there also needs to be some way for a player to contact support with a ticket regardless of response time I mean if i could get a ticket and it would take a week but those accounts would be banned I would be completely fine with it.,1
2012,probable one of the best free to play ww2 games out there i really enjoy playing it,1
2012,"very good game for early access very realistic, but would love to see if you could add the anzacs in to the game because they played a major part in word war one",1
2012,"Okay straight off the bat, I did not like this game at all, for like, two reasons.Reason No1: The lag is ♥♥♥♥in' unbeliveable. I suck at FPS but i can usually get 1 kill per half hour of play, nope, not even close, i died 13 times before my game timed out, i think it timed out... i'm half thinking that i was kicked for ""feeding"" not sure.Reason No2 (my most prominent issue with this game): This issue was in the damn Tutorial. I was told to destroy some explosives with a pack of C4,I thought, ""Sure no problem, you mean this box over here that clearly has explosives on it?"" *dies* ""... was that not it? let me look around for something else then..."" *10 mins later* ""there is literally nothing else that even remotely resembles explosives, this has to be it..."" *dies* ""am i doing it wrong? am i too close? i'll stand further away and put it right on top of it then..."" *dies* ""i can't stand any further away!"" at this point i got angry and decided to throw the C4 willynilly all over in the hopes of getting lucky.(announcer guy): ""alright now that that's done."" (me) ""i'm sorry... what? you wanted me to... throw the C4, over this wall, with no indication that the thing i need to blow up is there?""Now i'm fully aware that i may be an idiot and i just didn't hear him say it was there, so i waited for my friend who was playing the tutorial at the same time as me to get to that point, so i could check that it wasn't just me... but no, we were given no indication of where to find the thing we were supposed to blow up.Yes i know two reasons isn't really enough to judge a game, but i judge a game on playability and how easy it is to learn to play, the tutorial other than that part was sub-par at best and we had instances of random glitching into places we weren't supposed to be in, like the railing the instructor stands on, which we had to clip out of.Now take from this review what you will, it's my personal experience with the game and my personal feelings towards it, the positive reviews out weigh the negative so maybe i was really unlucky.",1

2012,"This game is very worth buying for only $20 in fact it is the best Alpha i have played in a long time :) the only down side of this game is that there are a stupid amount of hackers who will just take away hours, days even weeks of work. If you look on my rust photos that ive been bothered taking you'll see what im talking about!!! >:( But a good way to deal with this is to join a friend that knows if there are hackers on their server or a better way join a youtuber's server becasue they are the ones that really care.

2012,"1. It is really annoying when you finish an event and keep clicking 'Enter' to quit, and you end up starting another event. I believe most of players would take a break from playing or have some time to check the upgrades that have just been unlocked from the previous match.2. There should be a warning when purchasing cars that you can't even use for the chamipionship until 20 events later. (I kept saving up using my 60's mini to buy an M3, thinking I will be doing 80s events after getting it, then I found out you have to progress from the 60s to the era that you want to play. Come on Codemaster, just make all eras available at once, most people born in the 1980s wouldn't have much interest in those 1960 or 70s old school cars)3. Give us the option to turn off not only the main menu music, but also the ones between race loading, that music is not appealing to everyone, and to me it is annoying.4. Need a tutorial, with lessons ranging  from tunning to detailed explanation of the instruction terminologies such as 'don't cut'. This game is much more refined than it was in early access period, I now change my review to positive :)",0

2012,"The only initial reason why I got this game was so I could yell ""SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEEEEEEEEEECCCCCCCCCCC!!!"" like a dingus for the rest of my life playing this, and now we can crash land into an unknown abyss pondering on what lies ahead for us travellers and then try to set up a little civilization just to get by. It has changed so much since 2013 and many people may complain that we're proceeding into complex gmaeplay too fast and possibly too soon. Although, the update for a more complex gameplay is what makes the game we know today after 2 years of it's development and it still goes strong today.pros:-""SPAEC!!!""-crash landings-endless possibilities (not literally, but possibly)-more chances of dying from being a dingus-still contains its previous aspects before the big updatecons:-none that I know of so far (unless people complaining about its new complex system counts)Overall, it is still a great game to goof around with your friends along with more possible role play scenarios (if you guys are into that stuff) and even though this has been one huge step-up, it is still the game we know and love to enjoy.",1
2012,"I have to say, this game hit my high expectations and it hits basic MMORPG standards which is fun alone itself without the detail and stuff which makes it classed as ""barely a game"" but it's fun. I mean, it has it's dowfalls (possibly for now) like no Aussie server (but I ain't complaining), extra worlds pre-made from the developers (makes it easier on you skyscraper kids who like fancy XP) and that is as much as I can list for now. There may be more that I haven't encountered or listed but this definitely does make me fancy this for more.",1
2012,"Ok, this is really difficult to explain as far as...well, EVERYTHING goes. It is definitely not your average dating sim and that is a fact that we know. To be honest, I'm not the usually one to mess with dating sims nor am I one to be into this side of games but this somehow bypassed my attention since it was a bit more intersting than what I thought.When I first started playing this, I was more afraid of the ""sightings"" at first or what I might be in for but as I progressed through it started to become second nature and I will say this to those who are in this position, just let it happen, it will end.This is one true masterpiece due to it's playability and of course, good choice of appearance and personality to each girl and it mixes quite nicely and with it being a mix of ""Candy Crush"" as everyone would say, think or express (which makes sense since it is pretty much the only game that not many people can tear themselves away from other than Bejeweled). I would also like to add the end, is never the end. There is more ""bedwork"" that needs to be done  but I won't spoil it for those progressing or those interested except for this bit, once you have done all of the girls and I mean ALL of them, there is a thing called ""Alpha Mode"". Trust me, you NEED to get your game faces on because just getting your night date over and done with like it's a walk in the park and then enjoying ( or however you deal with the matter like waiting for it to get over and done with) the screams of joy from your girl isn't going to cut, this mode is no joke, as soon as you start, it starts NOW, as in as soon as you initiate it and the delight side of it is taken away and is officially a rage game at a certain degree but those who know their ways can achieve the best.P.S (EXTRA SPOILER): It also involves a neko and an alien but you guys can figure out how to achive their hearts. plus the achievement name for the alien is hilarious and it was well thought of as well for the name of it is ""ayy lmao"" and once I saw that, I spent a few minutes trying not to crush my brain from laughter and pass out from lack of oxygen, it's my weird humour that I like.P.P.S: You have to do quizes on these chicks so you better learn them up and get 'em right and you'll have to learn cat stuff and try and be an astronomist for the neko and alien so...you should ask if you could join NASA while you're at it.Rating:Candy getting crushed by 24 bewbs/10(DAMMIT, another spoiler XD)",1

2012,"I first played the masterpiece that is Skyrim back near its release day in 2011 and I can still clearly remember my exact experiences and overwhelming feeling of excitement and joy I got while playing it. I spent nearly all of my hours on Skyrim on that one charecter I first made and started him off as the iconic sword and shield wielding dragon slayer that we all got boners over in the trailer and maxed that out and then switched to a duel-wielding berserker that tore apart my foes in a flurry of blade slashes and then decided to max out my sneaking skills when joining the dark brotherhood and thieves guild and transformed that into a sneaky bow and dagger wielding charecter that took out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly Thalmor and unsuspecting adventurers before they could even see me and finally turned my charecter into a duel magic wielding powerful arch-mage that had mastered both the destructive and healing powers that magic had to offer and ran around the world spamming the powerful master spell: Lightning storm, which when combined with my high level enchanting skills to make destruction spells cost 0 mana could take down any foe in just a few seconds of aiming and blasting away.Anyway you get the picture, I ended up spending a good 500 hours on that one charecter back when I played on my PS3 and then later moved onto PC and made Skyrim one of my first buys. I remember being so depressed when x-box users got the Dragonborn DLC a few months earlier then the other two platforms and couldn't think about the idea of not playing Dragonborn at the same time as other people but it eventually came out and I was almost as excited and filled with joy to play it as I was at the original release of Skyrim. My 100 hours of gameplay on Steam was with the DLCs alone without doing any of the side quests or guild missions that the game had to offer and I plan on going back to the world of Skyrim and doing it all again eventaully as this is and possibly always will be the greatest RPG ever made.As for a rating? Well i'd be delusional if I gave it anything less then a 10/10 and with the base game being so incredible alone as well three awesome expansions being added and the edition of the greatest mods and modding community that gaming has ever seen, I have no hesitation in giving this game an 11/10!I can't bare to wait another 4 years for The Elder Scrolls 6 and have no doubt that it will be able to surpass it's legendary predecessors and become another shining gem of gaming and be talked about for years just like it's past brothers Skyrim, Oblivion and Morrowind.",1
2012,"This game is amazing! The world of Pandora is unique and absolutely crazy!!! It has all the features of great RPG games and shooters alike, combined with a long main quest line and loads of awesome DLC, I can easily recommend this game to everyone! :D",1
2012,"So I just recently completed the main story of Fallout and found myself sitting on 80 hours of gameplay with many more waiting to be played in this huge, amazing world. I haven't felt the same way that I felt while playing Fallout 4 since I first played Skyrim back in 2011. There have been many improvements made upon the past games and the diverse, dynamic, sometimes very scary world of Fallout 4 delivers an intense and compeling playthough that will leave you nothing less then astounded by how much work has been put into this game. The world is huge and packed to the brim with content and the amount of detail put into every square inch of this game is insane. However I don't think ill be putting as many hours into this game as I did in Skyrim (500 on one charecter on console and another 100 playing through the expansions on PC), but that's mainly because I just prefer the fantasy worlds of the elder scrolls series over the nuclear worlds of the fallout series. I can't wait to see what the upcoming DLCs bring to this beautiful game, aswell as what the great modding community can do to touch up any small things people don't like about the game (UI and inventory mods etc.) and what amazing big stories and gameplay content they can add to this already content rich game. Apart from some small annoyences  So in conclusion my rating of this game would be a very solid 9/10 in its current state with an easy 9.5/10 once the mods and DLC start flowing out and is well worth the money to buy.",1

2012,"Warface is a fast paced gameplay and awesome violence. If you're playing this game you need to think fast for a strategy, shoot the enemies fast, and run quick towards the objective to beat the enemy. Each class has their own role such as the Rifleman gives ammo to his/her teammates. The Sniper / Marksman his/her role is to eliminate futher threats to support teammates to move forward also they can also kill and scout enemies from a distance. If you're using the Sniper class you'd better be patient and suffiecient. The 3rd class is the Medic now this is the important class this is between your life or death because he/she gives you med packs also when you die the medic will revive with a defibrillator so you'd better be fast to help and heal your team or they'd die. Last class that'd be the Engineer he/she is capable of repairing you're vest/armor to absorb less damage but it takes a few seconds to repair itand the best part you can arm/plant a bomb did you know you can defuse it. Now really what I've expected from the Engineer class in warface was to build traps , turrets and explosives and to plant them anywhere able to plant them. now the coolest part was shooting while sliding to kill the hostile/enemy did ya know when u come across the hardest obstacle make sure you can help them climb up or help u climb up to move on. If my review helped you can like or reply me to thank me, If not that's ok I'm not really good makin reviews its my first time anyways. Well God Bless Everyone!",2

2012,"O que falar de Portal 2? Fantástico, inovador, divertido... tudo isso você encontra nessa verdadeira obra prima. Mas uma coisa na qual eu gostaria de focar é o carisma imenso de cada um dos personagens: o locutor (que não sei bem se pode ser considerado um personagem) com os seu supostos elogios, Wheatley com os pássaros, Cave Jonhson e os limões, mas principalmente ela: GLaDOS. Depois dos eventos de Portal, que a deixaram profundamente magoada, ela simplesmente consegue se superar a cada câmara de teste. Cada frase, cada provocação constitui uma personalidade singular e extremamente carismática da antagonista. Gostaria ainda de ressaltar o excelente trabalho de dublagem (que inclusive rendeu um easter-egg no trailer do filme ""Cìrculo de Fogo""). Todo esse carisma dos personagens, aliado a uma jogabilidade admirável e muito bem desenvolvida pela equipe da Valve e uma ambientação espetacular (sem falar nas referências a Half-Life), fazem de Portal 2 um dos principais destaques da sua geração e com certeza, uma das horas mais bem-aproveitadas que uma pessoa pode ter. 11/10 ",1

2012,this is a really fun game. enjoyed all chapters in 31 minuets. :D,1

2012,"Man this game is sick as holy crap. highly recommend yall fellas to get dis game. Many hours of fun you can have with it, just don't get too stuck in to it fellas. Love the items its kind of a mix between tf2 and cod but so much better than both of these games (especially cod).",1
2012,This is one of the most outstanding games in the shooter genre. Creeping past enemy lines and destroying peoples faces with snipers has ever been so satisfying. The only downside is that there are only 20 levels but at least theres an amazing story right? There are also many parts to them so that is pretty cool.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes shooters and stealth games. I actually recommend the whole series.If I had to give this a rating it wwould be 8.5 out of 10,1
2012,"Probably the best CS game yet. Yeah Source was good but this is next level stuff. The graphics are good, the maps are good, the voice acting is good and the custom weapons are sick. Probably one of the best FPSs ever.",1
2012,"Ace Of Spades is a bit like minecraft but with guns. There is no crafting or mobs to fight though. Not that this makes it a worse game though. There are heaps of cool gamemodes like infection or zombie, CTF, Demolition and my favourite VIP. Ace Of Spades is a wonderful blocky FPS that takes about 1 and a half months to master. I would give it a 7/10",1
2012,"POSTAL 2 is possibly one of the most funny/weird/f*cked up games we have ever seen. Really who cares about graphics if it's fun to play? That is what I think about this game. The story is very amusing but a bit confusing WHY U WOULD HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE DOING A WEEK'S WORTH OF ERRANDS?This game is hilarious, fun and a bit difficult really. Your always getting caught up in stuff instead of doing what your supposed to do like GTA.Now the best part of this game is definetely-PEEING! Who can go this whole game without peeing once?Anyway I should wrap this up. POSTAL 2 is an amazingly fun game with f*cked up stuff just waiting to happen. You could be stuck in a battle with the police, laughing your head off or escaping from prison. This is basically an FPS version of GTA so it is very fun and amusing.I give POSTAL 2 a 9/10",1

2012,"this game, omg wow. It's so god damn awesome. The artwork is stunningly beautiful, i could look at it forever. The music is amazing as well. If i have the sound track i would listen to it and it would never get old. The gameplay is just superb. The use of both strategy and bruteforce keeps you on your toes the whole time. It's balanced and unique and the abilities (or functions as they are called) are fun and easy to use. And they can even use those functions to upgrade other functions as well as being passive buffs for yourself which i also found unique. And on top of all that the story was just so awesome. It was so wonderfully written and even with small voice acting, it was done well. Overall, this game is a masterpiece for me, 10/10",2

2012,"I love this game, it has its issues but I still love it.The fighting style is something I havent found anywhere else but to be fair, there are plenty of times when a glitch or a bug becomes far too noticeable. I would still give it a try though.",1
2012,"A game that is although a bit buggy from time to time, is still crazy fun. Nothing in this game requires you to pay to win, in other words although there are items you can buy with real money it remains a complete choice.",1
2012,So fun,1
2012,"I never thought I would be able to play this game because it was initially released on the Wii U, but now with the port I was quick to pick it up. Overall I really like this game with a few things that I thought need working on:- Sometimes when I go to change the input for the 'Run' button I cannot push any button I just have to restart and hope for the best- The 'Run' button- The changed controls for the 'Hover' Wisp (I dont know, maybe I'm doing something wrong)- The Snowball Act (Even though it is just one level)- and finally turning whilst using the 'Run' button as it seemed to slow down too much and felt very clunkyI'd rate this game a 7.5/10",1

Melee combat feels abit sluggy could use more workIf you enjoy complex crafting its got that tooHavent explored all the map yet but it is beautiful.Community is friendly.Game runs well on max settings on my Computer, but i got a GTX980 and a i7 4790k so i guess i can't talk.Lag is a issue.Only buy if you dont care about spending the $20. But would recommend keeping a eye out for this one when development gets better.Some positive number/10 would kill a Viking while singing ave maria again",1

2012,"Really fun but would only play with friends, not very fun playing on your own (in my opinion).",1
2012,"I bought this game after playing Mount & Blade: Warband, I thought same people means another good game and at the time it showed promise. But over the time I've owned it, the updates and announcements have only really being bug fixing or removing planned updates. This game is definitely nowhere near complete, it is buggy, lacks playability, most would probably lose interest after 10 minutes. Devs have completely screwed this chance",1
2012,"Love this game, the 3d real life based setting is just great.",2
2011,"i really wanted to play this game so badly, looked at the reviews and after that i straight away installed the game, didn't take  long and as i launched it i was so excited. I watched the tutorial, i was so HYPED. Then..... i tried to look for a match..... waited over 10 minutes, still nothing. i just gave up, if there were many more people playing this game i would certainly come back to it but right now, theres barely anyone on.. i was so disappointed. I will try finding a match another day but if i can't for a while i'll just probably uninstall it. so sad...",1
2012,Ok i only have to say a couple things about the game... in a list!1. updates keep coming so theres always new stuff to do2. 2d (yes i now *2d sucks* but when was the last time you played a 2d game thats really fun... thats what i thourght)3. building fighting roaming diging shooting casting fighting (i can go on forever)4.graphics... thats all i have to say5. if you dont play in fullscreen so at the corner of the game theres a x well look left where it says terraria. THERE MORE WORDS AND THEY CHANGE EACH TIME YOU OPEN IT6. bosses theres ot just one or two THERES ABOUT SIX OR SEVEOk i could go on forever but as you can see GO PLAY DA GAME,1

Definetly worth the money!",1

2012,"This game is a fast-paced awesome MULTIPLAYER game.The multiplayer is captilized because that is the huge fault of this game, when your waiting for players this is the worst game but when you have at least 4 people on a server it's an insanely fun game.WARNING: It has a steepish learning curve (use the internet for tutorials)",1

2012,"A very nice RTS game, epic battles, massive sieges and a fun campaign. Be aware that it is quite an old game with quite old graphics so don't expect wonderful visual performance but still a fun game to play. Probably better of getting this game on sale since but $12.99 isn't massively over priced.",1
2012,"Damn!Thats my first impression, it's a hell of a game. It sucks you in from the first second. I have never been a fan of horror games but this is a very nice one, I wouldn't quite call it a horror but it's definetly a thriller. It is keeping me on the edge of the seat with clammy hands troughout. Everyday so far I have been coming back to this for an hour or so.The game mechanics are awesome, the combat feels good and it's really fun. Very large possibility for a stealth approach or an all in guns blazing approach. 9/10!",1
2012,One of the best FPS i've ever played :),1
2012,"Possibly the funnest FPS i've played in a very long time, I love everything about this game. Great weapon customisation allows you to make guns how you like them, A unique crafting and hunting system to help you survive the massive open world of the tropical Island. Great storyline that makes you want to complete it. It might be a little pricey but it is worth the money you put in in my opinion.  Just be wary before you purchase this game since it is quite demanding on your system so just make sure you can run it properly before buying this but overall a great game.",1
2012,A very fun game with great new mecanics and some very interesting characters how ever it is over priced in my opinion for the time you can actually play it for. I completed the game on normal difficulty in 15 hours and you could probably do it a bit quicker so just be aware of that.Overall a fun game with a good story and definetely worth a play if you can get it on sale!,1
2012,Great game if you are a fan of massive battles against monsters with a huge party or maybe taking on the world by yourself. If I was to compare it to another MMO it'd be Diablo 3 but since this is free you might as well try it out. It has very nice character customisation so you can create your very own warrior just how you like him or her to be with a skill tree to choose perks from the size of Russia.This game has greatly improved since the beta and has a nice storyline with multiplayer aspects to it. Fun game to play with friends.,1
2012,"This being my first Tomb Raider game I ever played I will try give you my best summary of this game as to if it is worth buying.The short answer is yes, IF it is on discount. $20 is quite a lot of the content that you get in my opinion. It doesn't have a lot of replayable aspects to it and the gameplay is very controlled.My major pros were:* The beauty, amazing visual performance* Fun, action packed gameplay* Very accesible, meaning it's well suited for new gamers as well* Fun mechanics such as climbing, free running sort of movementsMy major cons were:* Very controlled gameplay, the game gives you a very easy path to follow* The storyline is average, it comes over as not very well thought about* Customization in my opinion is meh-ishOverall a 7/10 game, Definetely worth playing trough if you get it on sale!",1

2012,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ only play this game want to play a game that is fun try somthing else,1
2012,"This game is amazing. Complex at first, the game has a good tutorial that explains the main concepts. The game has lots of layers and multiple ways to win, either through, science, culture, and diplomacy, or war and domination. This enables you to not always crush everyone, but to be diplomatic or be more cultural/scientific. Your social policies can give you edges in certain areas of your Civilization, and often one thing is connected to another. More science research means better army which leads to more diplomatic power and so on. Only negatives are that sometimes the worker automation does not work and that one game can take days to finish. Multiple characters and DLC enable endless replayability without the game becoming boring. Overall, a great game.",1
2012,"Great game, takes about three to four hours to complete. It gets a bit slow from time to time, but in the end it's quite good. Not really a game that stands out for gameplay, but stands out for story and content. Really enjoyed it.",1

2012,Espetacular,1
2012,"The game is remniscent of the Dungeon Keeper series and provides a slightly nostalgic feel. The graphical style and detailed overworld are quirky and creative but are ultimately overshadowed by the slow placed and repeitive gameplay. A major downfall is in its lack of flexible micromanagment and preset room layots. Players are also prevenetd from changing preset room layouts at the start of each new map which limits creativity and needlesy increases difficult as the treasure hold is always placed close to the entrance (where enemeies enter to plunder your dungeons treasure). Imire does provided a wide range of unique creatures and a interesting team combo feature, rewarding creative team combinations. The storyline also contains interesting aspects. Overall the agme is satisfactory if you want a casual play but is no Dungeon Keeper 3.",1
2012,well first off i highly reccomend this game way to much fun and super addicting u are gonna want to keep on playing after u first play it never gets old or boring,1
2012,Such a amazing game the storyline was so well written and done the story really had me wanting to keep playing on its such a intresting game and story leaving you wanting to find out what happens next i storngly recommend this game to anyone you definently will be wanting to buy it 10/10,1
2012,idk what to say except this game is amazing hands down better then the first and way more fun,1
2012,One of the best games i have ever played this game is going down in my books for one of the best story games ever this game was so well thought and planned out the storyline really keeps making you get more and more curious this is a must have for all Telltale fans,1
2012,really fun survival game kinda of a minecraft style survival but with way better graphics and guns involved really fun and addicting i highly reccomend this game to anyone wanting to try out something new,1

1998,"Where to begin with Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I'm going to keep it short. It has been around for ages, has the best tactics and teamwork in steam, but the community isn't always the best. It is also NOTHING like other FPS games. You can't just install, join a match and expect to win. Your aim will be off, you will spray at the enemy and miss nearly every shot. But that is why i love CS:GO. You spend time and time mastering the skill, the weapons and the maps. It is definatley my favourite game and always will be. Overall, wheather you like CS:GO or hate it, I think every player would agree, CS:GO is fun and enjoyable. Why would you play a game that isn't? That is why Counter Strike: Global Offensive has, and will be the best game ever!        :3",1

It is by no means a bad game, but if you came here looking for the mythical 'base building, multiplayer space game', then you will be dissapointed. otherwise, it's a nice, relaxing game about exploring hundreds of millions of proceduraly generated planets. The storyline is somewhat difficult to follow, but it is very well written and quite chilling. Maybe wait for a sale before purchasing.",0

I have some way to go before I can catch up with even the lowest pilot in the high-score table, but at least I can finish a race without difficulty, and enjoy it!The game works well on a low-end PC, provided that you choose a low resolution and the lowest graphics settings (which, while obviously not as good looking as higher settings, is not bad either).",1
2012,"It's a pretty solid dungeon crawler, and it's well thought out to capture a large audience. Beginners in the genre, such as myself, will find an extensive tutorial and pick a easy level of difficulty, allowing them to get going without frustration, while seasoned players can skip the tutorial and choose a much harder level (there are 6 level of difficulty if I remember correctly).Of course you'll find most of the genre's commonplaces right there as you expect them - from the visual style to the types of objects, the gameplay mechanics, etc. This has caused some people to blame the lack of originality, but at the same time, had the game departed too much from these standards, people would have complained about it (or simply been turned away) as well. So I think the developer made the right choices.All in all, a solid recommendation if you're attracted to dungeon crawlers, whether or not you're skillful at them.",1
2012,"That's a neat strategy game! It's easy to get into, and I like that there's a tutorial and a solo campaign before I get to go out there on my own, it will save me the unpleasantness of being owned like a noob while I am trying to figure things out.Great job, guys!",1

2012,"This was a wonderful experience. The story is well-written, and honestly, it prompted me to reflect on the value and shortness of life. It's a short visual novel, but it powerfully evokes emotions in the brief time we get to know the protagonist and Setsumi, whose lives are made brief due to their respective illnesses. Though the characters are distant at first, there is an intimacy between the them that develops which was touching and the soundtrack and voice track simply enhance the experience. For a doujin work, the artwork is quite well done and the minimalistic approach of presenting the setting and characters allowed me to have a more personalized experience with the story. The rare moments when I actually got to see the Setsumi's face actually felt precious. I really liked this approach. However, I did notice some inconsistencies with some of the art, but it was not terribly noticeable.It's a touching story about two terminally ill patients who are unhappy with their situation, who go on a search for a place that they can die peacefully. It's a tear-jerking story and it is well worth the time.",1

So griefers and slow-witted people, stop reading now.So far the game has amazing combat scenarios where you can't just do something very stupid to get out of the situation, say crowd surfing a bunch of zombies or slipping past them because there was just one tiny opening in their swarm. This makes it difficult because it slows down our instincts because we've gotten used to fast paced shooters like Team Fortress 2, Call of Duty, Left 4 Dead and the Counter-Strike series, in which it gives us a truly unique experience where we have to stick together, conserve our supplies sparringly and work as a team in order to fully enjoy this game.",2

Having the same controls based on the Counter-Strike mod for Half-Life its gameplay still remains faithful but with a boost with the latest engine and modernization of some guns. Compared to other games that require an unfair leveling system, this game forces players to make critical decisions, work as a team, improve on dexterity, polish hand-eye coordination.Hint: Be a sport, If you win it is because of the team's effort, if you lose they're just better than you(Unless the legitly cheat).",1

2011,"This game is OK but not worth the $1 to throw at it. Not know that this was an early access game I threw myself in to it hoping for a fresh game, one I haven't seen before. So I did what I usually do... Not look at anything on the game. Well now I wish I would and finding out that it was early access after I had played it makes it worse. I already have a dislike to early access as most games get forgotten and unfinished and I don't like the idea of paying for a game that hasn't even been finished and the devise thought they could get a couple of bucks out of it before they actually bother finish it. I know this isn't every early access game but a lot are like this. This game from the looks of it was either rushed, not cared about enough, or by inexperienced devise. Im sorry if it's the last option but you will need some helpful criticism. First of all I noticed the controls for the torch, these are horrible you can either not do anything and it will snap to the direction you are facing which leads to very disorientating gameplay ad there is no smooth animation for the snap lock and leaves the player felling more or less dizzy, or you can hold the left mouse button the whole time to control the torch which is annoying while trying to do platforming but is much easier then the snap control. This was very annoying through he whole game as you do have to use the torch as a weapon and making it a prime function without taking much care for smooth animation is not done well. While trying to find an option to maybe have it as a consonant on the mouse control I found myself exiting the level which made me instantly dislike this game. First of all there was no are you sure you want to exit the level, second no indication what so ever through the game did it say if you want to exit the level press ESC, this may not seem like that big of a deal and it wouldn't be in any other situation but in mine I was near the end of the level with all the collectibles and I had exited and was forced to play the level again but this time I ha dlost interest in collecting the letters. Another issue I have is that there are no options, none what so ever, except when you boot up the game it asks what graphics you would like windowed yes or no and resolution, for the very basic of settings these are there is no way to change them in game. One other thing that really bugged me about this game is the ♥♥♥♥ing narrator, jeez can you come up with some different lines, every single level has the narrator saying the same thing over and over again, it's like a broken record, and I'm not kidding at the start of every level there is the same cut scene of the narrator saying some bull and during every level he says the same thing, and at the end of every level there is another cut scene. Not to be discouraging the narrator has a nice voice but maybe get him a few more then 3 things to say. Now one thing that really bugged me about the game play was that every time you die you go all the way top the start of the level usually this would be OK, it gives consequence to the players death but it is so easy to die in this game from the odd camera angle and the (let' face it) cliché platforming with no real unique aspect means you have to start the level again and when this happens you loose all of your collectibles. This is the most frustrating part because even though the platforming is hard simply because of other issue and not the way it is designed, a big portion of the game comes froms getting the collectibles and after dying a few time to some random issue I quickly lost interest in getting the collectibles which unlock additional levels, which I could not bring my self to even collect the letter to play because I found myself wanting to stop playing this game instantly. Another aspect of the game I didn't enjoy was the enemy if you can even call them that, there are two enemy's, white slug things that slowly move towards you and little white sperm things that move quickly towards you, for a game with the subtitle 'A game to fight inner demons' I did not find myself fighting any inner demons the most I got was having a good laugh at the ridiculous design of an 'inner demon' and the variation of these inner demons (the small sperm things) do not come in till the 4th level which is the second last level in the game. Which brings me to my next point the length of this game is ridiculous it is less then an hour I'm sure if you went through all the levels getting the collectibles it be a bit longer but no more then 2 hours it is ridiculous, if you are going to make a game with this kind of game play and non existent story telling at least make it long enough so people get their moneys worth. Another aspect I found odd was music or the lack of, the first time I heard music was in the last stage of the game and there was no epicness to it like in dark souls where music would only play during boss battles but dark souls made the iteration of music mean something, it made the player feel like they were doing something epic not bloody doing mundane platforming.So if you are looking to buy this game I wouldn't bother the $1 price it is definitely not worth it in the sate that it is in now.",1

2011,"Black Mesa is a great game, I played through the mod many times and I bought this version mainly for the multiplayer, which did not disappoint.The multiplayer currently only has the deathmatch and team deathmatch gamemodes, but they're both a lot of fun. Deathmatch is just chaotic killing and I'm sure team deathmatch is a lot better with friends than it is on your own. The maps are full of detail, being big enough to survive and find a weapon, but not too big that you're isolated from the action. It's a shame there are only two gamemodes, but I feel the quality and quantity of the maps make up for that, and I'm looking forward to when they do add different gamemodes in the future.The singleplayer is better than it was in the mod, there are several significant changes; the new sounds and models are great, the general look is better with various subtle changes, and some major ones too. Even though the game is unfinished, it still has a lot of replay value to it. I've played the mod excessively, yet I'm sure I'll play this newer version many times until the game is completed. So far, there haven't been any game-breaking bugs, the game crashed several times when I first started and there have been a few dodgy textures floating around but they are not frequent enough to be annoying.Overall, I would recommend this game. It is reasonably priced by today's standards, and there is a lot to do in both the single and the multiplayer, even being unfinished.",1

2011,Yes very cool,2

2011,"Starbound. Well what can I say. A game full of adventure that is just waiting for you to jump in and explore. Featuring an infinite number of randomly generated planets, which are themselves filled with many secrets to discover such as catacombs, villages, science labs even airships. The list could go on forever. One of the many beauties of this game is that once I'm done with one planet, I can just move onto the next and so on, with every new planet being a brand new adventure. The game is in early access, but you wouldn't even know it because this game is as playable as the next. I am really looking forward to what else this game has in store for the future.9/10.",1

2011,"Amazing game and storyline, well worth the $$$You can't help but get emotionally attatched to the characters along the journey, they all have unique personalities that you can't help but love.. or hate. Being able to choose between options that will either make or break people makes this game feel real, like it's up to you what happens and not the character you play as. Definitely one of my favourites!Well done Telltale! 10/10",1
2011,good game,1
2011,"This is the first time I have ever written a review, but this is one game that warrants some positive feedback. After backing 'This war of mine' on kick starter and following it through its journey I fel in love with the story behind the game and after playing it on steam for the past week it has proven itself in a class of its own.",1
2011,good game,1
2011,"This game is sure to break your face.... The story is engaging, and as my friend said ""A masterpeice of a game""The soundtrack gives you emotion as you play the game. It's not just one song that plays over and over again, but a vary in soundtrack that keeps you engaged and excited. As for gameplay, this game is fast paced, action packed and forgiving. This game is perfect for people who have always wanted to let their emotions out through games. If you die, just restart, but angrier, that anger helps fuel the gameplay to it's best.",1
2011,One of the best Star Wars games out there. I remeber playing this many years ago and it can be hard at some points (Like the final boss that bloody cheats) but it is still great. Good for anyone that likes Star Wars or that isnt a fan. 1313/10,1
2011,"This game, oh this game! In my opinion, it's better than the latest AvP. But, it has no shotgun!As the marine, there is one guy telling you what to do every now and then which I found annoying because I just wanted to have the same kinda experience the people had in the movies. The predator is good, but I found it annoying that marines can sometimes stilll see you when you have cloaked. This game is great and you should buy it, even if you have not seen any Alien movies! 9/10",1
2011,This is fun and all but It is basically the same as the previous 2 games. I did like how there were new gadgets but they were very much like the gadgets from the previous games.,1

2002,"I've played the beta of this game and this is no different. Although there is some skill involved, it still feels like a pay to win because when you get passed beginner level you are more likely to rage quit all the time with pros out gunning you with better armour and weapons. However it looks beautiful and brings a different genre of shooters on the market. Just hoped they would make more maps in the future but you'll still look like a badass in this game.",2

2011,I love Garry's Mod and everything about this game. Love going online and playing prop hunt with randoms or setting ti up for Lan parties with mates. Very interesting and different little mini games to keep me going,2
2011,"Very slow and annoying that you cant skip a lot of the cut scenes. I am not very far into the game but after your first achivemnt it stops giving you hints on how to kill the person and you have to figure out random stuff. Like killing Gene, the map tells you to go straight to where Gene is but first you have to stop and get the screw driver from the other guy, but to figure that out I actually had to look it up online. Not much fun and very slow",2
2011,"What can I say, I loved the first one and I love the second one. Awesome shooter game to play either by yourself or Co Op. always interesting missions and I'm so hooked on the game that small cut scenes got me right in the feels.",2
2011,It's really one of those games you just gotta buy and play. Go in with an opened mind then laugh at all the random stuff that happens. Reall enjoying this one.,2

2011,Adictivo.,1
2011,"No se por donde empezar a describir a este juego si no solamente tenemos que seguir la historia que nos cuenta el narrador pero es cosa nuestra obedecerlo o no , demostrando que el juego incluso diria que romperia la cuarta pared, el juego en si conoce muy bien al jugador promedio, saviendo que cada accion que hagamos el narrador soltara algunas frases que nos sacaran mas de una risa, en si el juego puede ser aveces corto, pero en si es un buen juego para salir de la rutina ( en mi caso shooters), en fin mi opnion es si merece la pena yo creo que si, si estas aburrido de cualquier juego te recomiendo este ya que creo que te sacaras unas buenas risas",1

2011,"Hear me out i feel if you've never played TF2 you could get used to this game, but if you have played TF2 then you will not enjoy this. I noticed alot of servers werent even full and the ones that were are laggy, not bad laggy but when your fighting its a huge streak the will just freeze everything. I sort of enjoyed this game it is very much like TF2 but different, ALSO if you have played TF2 your skills will not transfer you will be like the normal bad player in TF2. Over all i give this game for people who havent played tf2 a 8/10 but for the ones who have a 5/10. I dont recomend buying this game but if you put alot of time and effort you will master Team Fortress Classic.",1

2011,Better than Sanic Boom Boom and Sanic06 buy dis game.,1
2011,Very Fun And ALOT more fun with freinds. Story is like a mario game but the game it self makes up for everything else.  8/10,1
2011,"This Game Is Awesome! The Story is really quirky and sometimes gets a chuckle out of you.  Plat Forming is pretty solid, I do recomend you have a freind as it is alot more fun, But you can still have some fun in the Single Player Version. I didnt really see a point to replay game after I completed it. For once the PC version can be played with the KeyBoard, Games like Super Meat Boy Require the Controller but this one is Either way. 8/10 Buy this game :)",1
2011,"Looks like the original, runs well on a low end machine. As a game it's fairly repetitive in the sense of what there is to progress through the story. The lack of versatility in how to race through the levels is showing and a reflection of the time this was originally brought out, retro frustration will definitely settle in. Controls are by far the worst aspect, not a sympton of porting I would think but the original game's fault, any device you plug in will not optimise your experience, you most likely won't reach a satisfactory level of control over the pretentious nature by the end of the story mode if you stick with that but if you have the drive to go into practice mode and put in the hours go for it. If you can stomach that part then you'll enjoy this as a whole.Great soundtrack, nicely priced, making your own graffiti is nifty to have and an orgy of colour paints a ficitonalised version of Tokyo to play in.This game solely has my respect for it spawned its (FAR) superior successor in Jet Set Radio Future which would be a very welcome addition to the PC platform. Playing this game will only make you make you realise how sweet a JSRF port will be, almost impossible to fail if the port quality is the same.",1
2011,I really wish this was avalible on mac......such a shame,1
2011,great game,1

2011,i actually stopped playing this game cuz it was too easy,1
2011,this game is da bomb,1
2011,it use to be playable but now its not because of how good looking they made the graphics in this game look back then the graphics looked bad but it was playable so yeah dont buy the game unless you got a good fast computer,1
2011,"If you like reading then this game is for you, if not then don't buy this game cause there is like no ♥♥♥♥ing gameplay in it!",1
2011,"DayZ is probably one of the most played open-world Zombie games to date. It was one of the most successful mods in history, and although the standalone isn't looking so crash-hot now, it's definetely headed in the right direction. My advice would be to buy this game right now, even if your not really happy with the current build.I only say this because the difference between the mod and this game is vastly different, and as such the developers are trying to take this in a more realistic direction. This won'tbe agreeable to everyone, of course, and sometimes I think they've taken it too far, and retracted from the game's appeal. Despite what I know they're aiming for, I think they have to consider that this is JUST a game, and shouldn't be crafted to a point where the community no longer enjoys it. Nevertheless, I'd recommend it time and time again as a great away to pass the hours with friends, through blood, sweat and tears. (Usually in that order).",1

2011,"the only reason this game doesn't have a higher metascore is because it was reviewed when it was first released. in ""flashback"" articles you'll see prevoulsy scorning critics giving it 10s because it's improved so much. maps have been added, crates like TF2, weapon skins, so many community contributions, map tweaks, gameplay upgrades, new game mode, the list continues. this game needs more players, all noobs welcome, the community can teach you the tools of the trade even if uyou're hopeless. :D have fun on CSGO, deffinitely worth anyones time (in my case, 400 hours of time (right now anyway))",1

2011,"DayZ is a good game but a few problems are that it's still in early access and it has many bugs that are a bit annoying to play with and the game can be quite boring without other people by your side when you first join, and the controlls take a little while to get use to (if you're havinng trouble with the controlls then just search up DayZ help/guide/walkthrough on the internet, that's what I did :D) but overall DayZ is a great game despite it's bugs and other problems it has. I recommend this game to everyone but make sure you can handle it (it's not scary but some people are just wimps).",1
2011,Definitly a GREAT game i recomend it with DayZ or the Island Life Mods,1

2011,"A must have game for any LOTR fan.When you are killed by an Orc, they have the opportunity to become promoted. Each and every single Orc has a name, personality, strengths and weaknesses. This gives them the opportunity to play a big part in Talions story. A big factor of why I and many others love the game.The combat and abilities are easy to learn, making it a game that players of all skill levels will be able to play.",1
2011,"The game was orginally from the PSP years back and I was sad that it wasn't available in consoles but all those sadness were blown away when I found out they made it to PC. Hopefully they also make the sequels come to PC too and if they do I'll be happy to spent my money and have a wonderful time playing it and progressing for the story.Straight to the point:-The Story is Wonderful and Depressing that shows how traggic war is and there are many more things you have to find out yourself. Drama hits hard on me in the game and the comedy made me laugh out loud (yes it's funny not joking).-Characters are likeable and the development is great, you'll eventually learn more about them; their past, favorite hobby and etc as you progress through the story.-There are different type of weapons that you can use for your different tactics whether it's defensive, Offensive of passively you role with.-Gameplay is impressive and unique for me, even if it's an old game still its really addicting. It's not require for people who are not a fan of turn based game.-I love the graphic, it matches the game really well and even if it's an old Game it doesn't really affect you when you progressly play the game. When the gameplay is good, then the graphic can be aside.-All and all the game for me was exciting and I give it a 10/10 along with the satisfied ending. It put a smile on my face.For the long one:The game is in 1935 C.E., the continent of Europa is dominated by two superpowers: The autocratic East Europan Imperial Alliance in the east and a commonwealth of loosely allied democracies known as the Atlantic Federation in the west. The economies of both powers depend on a precious multipurpose mineral called Ragnite. Its growing scarcity results in the Empire declaring war on the Federation, sparking the Second Europan War.The Empire uses its military superiority to quickly put the Federation on the defensive. Emboldened by their progress and momentum, the Empire decides to invade the neutral Principality of Gallia to seize its rich Ragnite deposits. (Go check Wiki or somethin to know more)The story was wonderful and depressing. We all know how war works all around the world, those who fight to protect or for hatred and ended Alive with a future or deceased without a future. While playing Valkyria Chronicles, you'll experience how traggic war can be (Well it is always), how power is the key to victory but yet some chose to fight naturally. People will do whatever it takes, even using ancient power for that sweet victory (It's the same as real life if one of the powerful leaders found something powerful to use it to rule the world) Then that's where Squad 7 comes in and prove that victory can be achieve naturally with tactics that can lead you to that victory.In the game you'll be controlling the Squad 7 and in command of 8-10 Units on the battefield and their Lieutenant; Welkin Gunther who rides a badass tank in the game. Each skirmish works differently and it lefts you thinking on how to plan your tactics carefully without making mistakes and not end up with your units being killed by raining bullets or really annoying RNG hitting you everywhere or in other words, you luck is on your side or not. Though it doesn't hurt to learn from your mistakes and refresh your mind into a new tactic that can achieve your victory. I re-runed alot of missions due to some flaws and RNG but then eventually I did achieve that sweet Victory (pleasurable)There are five classes that works differently with their own personal specialty.-Scout; scout the areas to locate your enemies and can go behind enemy lines.-Shocktrooper; storm enemies with their smg and gun them all down. (This class is my favorite amongs all)-Lancer; the tough guys with the big lance that can shread some armor.-Engineer; who repairs obstacles or vehicles and replenish ammo for your squad.-Sniper; headshot, headshot and more headshot.Now moving on to the characters.Personally I love the Characters, each one of them except Mexamilalin (I don't how to spell his name). Welkin Gunther is my most Favorite character in the game along side with Alicia, Rosie, Largo, Zaka and Isara (Most fav heroin). From the Start i didn't have any interested in the characters but eventually after knowing their, hobby,  past and passion, I grew deeply in love with them. Not saying only towards the Main Characters, even the secondary characters have their own personality that can effect in the battlefield and their very own description. There are some DLCs that involves some of the characters from the unit selection like Edy's Detachment (I like Edy too :3) Each character have their own personality and there are advantages and disavantages depending on the battlefield you are in. Some don't like to be lonely, some like to be alone, some like these terrain and etc.PS. Salveria is Hot.Weapons,Upgrading your units and progressing through the story lets you unlock more upgrades that can increase the power,accuracy or adding effects to your weapons, same goes with increasing your units hitpoint, def and unlocking some orders and pottentials. There are 3 types for the Bolt Action rifle, SMG and Sniper; Power, Range or Adding effects, it all depends on how you plan your tactics. I always been so eager to unlock more upgrades so I can upgrade my units to become more powerful and have an easy win in battles. I got nothing else to say about weapons since that's all.Graphic,Graphic doesn't bother me,I love it actually; it matches the game and story. it's an old game back in 2008 so what you expect? I can be very picky sometimes to graphics but if the gameplay is netter then the Graphic of the game can be aside. However I love the designs of the characters, outfit and military plus the castles and stuff.Not a good review but I have to say that I Love the game and it put a smile on my face at the end.

On the journey you go through many tests set by GLaDOs (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) while observing the environment trying to find a way out of the facility.

The game started off very simple but as I spent more time on it it became trickier and the missions became harder to accomplish. Don't let looks fool you.

2002,"Este não é um simples jogo copia do Left 4 Dead 2 sem Zumbis, este é um grande jogo baseado no Left 4 Dead 2. Os gráficos podem não ser de ultima geração, mas o que importa é a diversão e isto o jogo consegue fazer e muito! São inúmeras possibilidades que pode se fazer neste jogo, inúmeras táticas, como Stealth mode ou Heavy mode. Outra coisa interessante é as posições de algumas coisas (como cofres) que são mudados aleatoriamente para outro local, assim deixando o gameplay menos monótono. Jogar Offline é um tédio, não vais jogar 1 hora sem enjoar, agora jogar Multiplayer, nossa, é sensacional, divertido de mais! Sabe do que mais é sensacional? Sua dificuldade e sua trilha sonora. Tá lá você andando, inicia um roubo e começa aquela música de ação, você se envolve naquilo de uma maneira inexplicável, isto valendo também para o modo Stealth.

2011,"Fun game to play by yourself, but so much better with a friend/s. i recommend this game to everyone. i'v personally played just over 100 hours and i don't regret a thing. Also the shiftcodes are a cool feature (you basically get free loot).",0
2011,"PlanetSide 2 is a great game,there are 4 seperate maps which are massive, with all different enviroments.(Swamplands, snowlands come to mind atm)It's truely a MMOFPS with thousands able to be on one server at a time.With 3 different empires to play for-Terran Republic-New Conglomerate -Vanu SovereigntyWith 6 different unique classes there is something for everyone-Light assault, which have a very helpful jetpack.-Heavy assault, for those who like like a lot of bullets, using light machine guns to take down enemies.-Engineer, very useful, can give ammo to team mates.-Combat medic, basically just a medic.-Infiltraitor, uses a sniper rifle to take out enemies at a distance.-MAX, just a tank, used to push up and do serious damage.In conclusion,Its a great game and it's free, atleast try it out for yourself.in my opinion it's a grteat game and should be in your game library no matterwhat. with heaps to do you can get hours and hours out of it.I'm just over 130 hours and it feels as if i'v only just scratched the surface.9.5/10",0

I bet you have, and with all the parts, ragdolls, and tools in the game, plus mods you can download automatically from the menu, you can totally make it. And with some ridiculous game modes in multiplayer like Trouble in Terrorist Town and Deathrun, its sure to be a fun game.",2
2011,"All I've got to say about this game is that it is, probably one of the funniest first person shooters out there, right next to TF2. Well that isnt all I have to say. If your looking for a game with almost UNLIMITLESS types of guns this is the game for you. And with the weapon slots you unlock through the game you can have a Sniper, Rifle, Rocket Launcher, Pistol and Shotgun on you at the same time without making you slow like most other games would. Plus the fact that some guns when you reload them you throw them away into an enemy and it explodes. So to sum it all up, Great Game",2
2011,"Would definitely reccomend this. The mechs, fast paced action, sweet enviroments, and awesome shadowing which blankets its minimalist approach to textures are what makes this game amazing. The only thing its missing...people! I'll be at the menu screen going through all the regions and theres only 1 server between all of them. I don't think I've played enough yet to rate it but at the moment it seems to be one of the most exciting games I have played.",2

My only issue with this game is that because so many people had a dummy spit about the new patch (which I wasn't here before the new patch came out so IDK the difference) it is hard to find games. And I keep having to change my region to North American to find matches. Hopefully people come back and play the game more, so it's easier to find matches. Keep up the good work, 9/10.",1
2003,"The only WWI game that flows like the war it is based on, where as others are simply a skin Verdun though game play, environments, weapons and tactics/formations gives that static stuck in the mud feel that really pins the first war.  The maps are also interesting with your typical treeless miles of crater filled mud where only the quick of feet survive , half destroyed fortresses , trenches with players struggling in close quarter combat with pistols, grenades and bayonets, french farm land where men charge and die for a little more than 100 yards of corn only to reach trench on the other side  Not to mention that one reason I like this game is the use of automatic weapons is ether restricted to realistic levels or having disadvantages such as not being able to fire until deployed or having horrid hip fire accuracy.  If your interested in  -History of the great war (western front aka trenches in France) -first person shooters in a take and hold sort of game play -getting shell shock -wearing gas masks -using wacky weapons -having PTSD  your likely have fun with this game  Turn the gore on full you won't thank me for the PTSD but you will for immersion.

But, I saw that steam recommend that you play this game with a controller...unfortunately, I don't own one. Eventually, I brought the game and decided to try playing the game using the keyboard. At first it can be quite difficult to but I say within 30-45 mins you'll get the hang of it and will be fine with it. I have been playing as a single player which is still fine and great but I do recommend playing this game with a friend, buddy, pal etc. You'll have tons of fun as there seems to be alot of levels.",1

2010,"This game is better than most general FPS's that include a sniper theme inside the actual game. Why? Because it's directly centered around the tactics and style protrayed by modern military sniper. This game displays a set of youth ranged ballistics and areodynamics, which does occasionally draw away from a true expierience. While it may feature bullet drop to some degree, that is the only true force that with be acting aginst where you hit your target. It fetures no windage, elevation change or temperature, etc. However, for the average person interested in this theme of military force, the game offers a great time. Still looking for a true sniper game though, but it's worth the buy if you are new to things like this. I highly recomend setting this on the ""Hard"" setting, as it gets rid of the red dot which allows for a much better expierience as a sniper.",1

2010,I love it,2
2010,"Loved the game, loved the soundtrack, still love the game, still love the soundtrack, I can say the only person I wouldnt reccommend this game to would have to be somebody I loathe, this game is worth every cent, buy it!",1
2010,"Great game, worth buying, I wish I could purchase the soundtrack, it is amazing, its fun, but it really could be longer, I was quite dissapointed to see how short it was. If you like, Pokemon, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, or Legend Of Zelda, you might enjoy this.",1
2010,"I know I will get alot of hate for saying this, but this game.. is the BIGGEST PILE OF ♥♥♥♥ EVER, it is nowhere near finished, zombies still dont drop anything, zombies still walk through walls, and doors, and everything else, and of course the millions of annoying new features they add instead of fixing the zombie issues, like how about.. freezing to death, while bleeding to death, while starving to death, while being chased by zombies who hit you from 10 feet away, and also take around 100-200 hits to kill because most of those hits either miss, dont do anything, or are weakened because your weapon decides that it wants to take a break and sends your fists out instead.",1
2010,"Alien: Isolation..You would think that this game would be either a lag-fest, or another Colonial Marines, but not at all.Alien: Isolation is a really good game in my opinion, they don't send enemies at you too early, and if they do, they are easy to outrun or hide from, or possibly take them out one by one, lots of cool gadgets and tools to help you get around Sevastapol.Buy this game, even my craptop can run it without lag.",1
2004,love it 10/10 buy it!,2
2010,"Unturned is an entertaining game, Here give my opinion of the game: Unturned is a survival game like Day Z, because you're a guy you have to build your house and collect things for their survival and the cities are infected zombies. you need food, drinks and antibiotics to reduce the detoxification (detoxification increases when hit by a zombie). The game is fun to play in multiplayer, because having friends makes you share your items with others and has to use a lot of cooperation so that all players have things necessary to defend against waves of zombies. when I started to survive in the game, I thought it would be a game like rust, minecraft, terraria, etc.. but I found it different, there are many more things to do and what matters most in this game is the way to be able to have enough things to survive, from when you start to when you finish, the path between the two is as much fun in this game. Never give up on the game as always will have something to help you succeed. the concluion is that it is one of the best games that are survival and is in beta, the game is complete when the probability of finding the most entertaining game that was in beta will be higher. Keep updating unturned, having a good life.",0

2010,"Because of zombies maps and gameplay, the multiplayer map design(some could be better), The guns are balanced(mostly) and the Camos for the guns are just EPIC!!! The campaign could have been better( a lot better) and zombies could have had more maps. Like if there was 1 in every dlc ( there is one in all but 1 or 2). All round, Great Game. GET IT!!!!",2
2010,"YES. This game is great. definately the freshest cod in the franchise since Cod4. The campaign was epic if not a bit too short and the MP is awesome. Great maps and awesome gameplay comign from the exosuits. The only downside to the multiplayer, is that they need to either change it from skill based matchmaking to connection matchmaking or GIVE THIS GAME FREAKING DEDICATED SERVERS. overall. Worth buying, really great new ideas brought in by sledgehamr but it wont be the best cod. UNTIL the add dedicated servers.",2

2010,"The PC that I played this on was a beast machine, however if you have a PC under $1000 it is almost impossible to play this game which is not acceptable seeing as most $1000 PCs have hardware better than that of a PS4. From my experience the game is good, it is certainly not a fitting end to the Batman Arkham trilogy (origins didn't exist). I was surprise that 70% of this game is Battank simulator 2015, not pleasantry surprise but definitely surprised. The 30fps capping is not acceptable at all in 2015.to bored to type anymore so 6/10 for me, if i wasn't on a beast machine 3/10TL;DR Batman Arkham Knight has stopped working",1

If you're a TRUE fan of the game, this little change shouldn't bother you at all. I still love this game, and it's still up there as one of my favourites. In conclusion; yes.

2010,"Even though the game is only in alpha, DayZ Standalone proves to be fun, nerve racking and beautiful. I do admit the game does take a bit of getting used to, and the first few hours of the game can really deter a new comer to the game from playing again. But once you properly get into the game and have some supplies, that is where the true excitement of the game is found. The survival aspect of the game is already very detailed with you needing to eat food, drink water, bandage wounds, apply splints to broken legs, finding food and water, the list goes on and from looking at the DayZ Arma II mod, there will be a lot more things implemented into the game making it a lot more harder to survive. I highly recommend this to players looking for a survival game that isn’t mission based and gives you complete freedom to do whatever you want. I’m very excited to see what direction the game goes in over the coming months.",1

2010,this game is sooooooooooooooooooooooo fun. not only is there a lot of action but there are a lot of puzzles in the game to break up the action. the only problem with this game is the mediocre multiplayer. it is open world and there are heaps of things to do.If I had to give this game a rating 8.5/10 for the singleplayer and 5/10 for the multiplayer. for only 30.00 on wow hd it is a great buy as well.,2
2010,"The Batman Arkham series has been critically aclaimed for it's fast paced action, fluid combat and above all because ""you're Batman"". Batman Arkham Origins is a prequel to the series and although it is not as revolutionary as the other two games I would say it is still a great addition to the series. This game features Batman meeting some of the Gotham super-villains for the first time such as The Joker, Bane, Deadshot and Black Mask. The graphics in this game are a step up from Arkham City and Batman has a new batsuit that looks more armoured. The combat remains the same with a few new gadgets such as the concussion detonator. The story is great, it starts with Black Mask putting a bounty of 50 million dollars on the death of Batman. Eight assassins take up the offer Bane, Deadshot, Firefly, Deathstroke, Shiva, copperhead, Electrocutioner and Killer Croc. I will not tell you more about the story for spoiler reasons but I can reveal that there is a massive twist. There are many bossfights and I must say they were all very good and polished compared to the Arkham City ones that were stun, beatdown,stun beatdown,stun beatdown, knockout. The one I enjoyed most was the copperhead bossfight when she drugged you and she made you see lots of her and you have to beat all the clones to harm the actual copperhead. This was reminiscent of the arkham asylum scarecrow fear gas hallucinations. There was a few bugs and glithches the first time I played through, one made me not able to complete the game, but these have been generally fixed with patches so it should be fine play right now. The multiplayer is a new addition to the series , which I did not have very high hopes for but it surprised me and I found I loved it. There are 3 teams 2v3v3 You are either Batman or Robin on one side and the other 2 teams are Joker's goons or Bane's goons. As batman or Robin you fly around, sorry glide around taking out thugs stealthily because only a few bullets can kill you, while you do this a meter is filling up for every takedown and if this meter is full then Btman and Robin win however this is very hard to do although it is fun silent takedowning (is that a word?) real people for once, not that I'd do it in real life(I've triedmit didn't work but I got a sharp slap from one of my brothers).The Gang's job is to capture posts and kill off the other team's reinforcement counter. If one of the gang's are killed off then the other gang wins.Once per game one person in the gang's will have a chance to play as Bane or The Joker which is also an enjoyable experience. Overall Batman Arkham Origins is very good. The game felt new at the beginning but then it just felt like a bigger Arkham city until you meet The Joker then it feels like a unique game again. WB Montreal has done enough taking over Rocksteady for this game to make it an enjoyable experience but some of the game just felt like the same S**t put into a new title but thankfully there was enough variation to make this game feel like it's own game although it is not revolutionary. If you liked the last 2 games you will love this game because it is more of what you love and then some. I give this game 7.4 out of 10. Thanks for reading and remember ""your batman"".",2

I recommend that if you've played F-Zero (or even if you haven't but find it interesting) that you try this game. I picked it up in beta for $4 and even now, at $10, it is worth every cent I reckon.Screenshot of minimum settings[puu.sh].",1
2009,"This game is AWESOME. Nothing else to say. From the graphics to the loot to the weapons to the enemies, this game shines in everything. Voice acting is spot on and characters are well-animated. My only gripe though is that the vehicles are only meant to get you from place A to B, but it still is fun. I recommend this game to anyone who likes first-person shooters.",1
2009,"Call of Duty Black ops - Mac Edition was a very fun, and exilerating game. You unlocked many weopons each time you ranked up, and had many weopon upgrades and costomizable features. Many weopons were only used in certain maps, for example, a l968 sniper rifle (I think thats the name) wasnt used on Nuketown because it would get owned by famas and galils all the time. This game needs some serios addons however, as it became boring at higher ranks. I think the upgrades that should be added are:1.voice comunication2.Larger maps3.more weopons & equipment4.rides such as tanks-jeeps-bikes5.more camos (the only good one is tiger)I hope you guys enjoyed this quick review on Black ops - mac edition.GOLDIE OUT!",1
2009,"Es un juegazo de donde lo mires si te gusta el basket, le faltan muchas cosas que la version de PS4 tiene. Algo de lo mas molesto es que para jugar con un amigo tenes que tener mucha suerte para que te empareje no como en la version de PS3/4 que pones ""Jugar con un amigo"" y ya esta. Tiene bugs el juego, pero aparecen MUY de vez en cuando y lo peor que te puede pasar es que se te cague el partido al medio tiempo, sino otros bugs menores como que el arbitro no cobre un tapon ilegal. Sin dudas, compralo ;)",2

2009,"Sepia Tears is a F2P Visual Novel which has a rather romantic plot structure to it. The story is perhaps one of the best I have seen in while, at most times remaining cryptic and mysterious until the final part of the game came around. Now not giving much away about the ending but I personally found it very satisfying and the build up really made you emotionally invested in the protagonist so it made the ending that much more impacful. The game takes around 4-5 hours to complete depending on how fast you read and what choices you make. Now I have only played through this once and got the good ending, but I am assuming there are some other (worse?) ones (When I play a VN that is heavy in the feels, I tend not to even look up nor play the bad endings). Overall this game has a solid story, a solid soundtrack, and solid artwork, A must play for any visual novel fan, and hey its free (which is actually rather suprising for a game this refined).Verdict: 7.5/10Now please excuse me as I take heat from all the people on my friends list calling me a weaboo for playing anything that remotely contains anime.",1

2010,"Loved it, totally worth the 14$ Similarties: It's like Halo in Vs mode but more open for roaming (Vehicle searching nontheless) There's a wider range of weapons than Halo, Primary,Secondary,Adrenaline weapon and Item (Turrets/Knife) Classes: -Assault: Assault is pretty much the all around damage class in this game, they have OP adrenaline weapons when it comes to taking out huge groups of enemies.-Medic: Your all around support class (As name says) If you can utilize medic class as well as know your augments right (Will be explained) you will be the tankiest mother f**** out there.-Recon: Stealth/Singular opponent type, really good for taking out the boss monsters when headshotting. (Recommend for experienced players)Augments: Augments are basically buffs in other words. But once you buy them they automatically apply and are permanent. For example: Wolverine-Allows you to regenerate health overtime.As a LvL20 assault i recommend these augments: Wolverine,Double armor,Vampire,50% bonus credits (Since you got alot of aoe with adrenaline) Energy 2x, Jetpack booster for when you take on boss monsters you can constantly hover for a much longer duration while regenerating.",1

2010,"it's really good, despite the server crashing every 30mins and being so unstable.",1
2009,"Not even worth playing anymore. It has gone WAY to pay to win. When i first started this it was actually viable, i just recently came back and unless you're going to pay loads of $$$ then you're not going to get very far. Most traps,monsters and other stuff you can get for your castle for defences are locked and you'll need to either buy the infinite pack or unlock each one using ingame special currency which costs real $. And having to validate your castle is what annoys me the most since you have use your own hero to validate, which means you have to clear your castle without dying. If you die then it wont validate, you can PAY to get the community to validate your castle but that also costs $$ because you can only use special ingame currency inorder for the community to validate it for you. You can ask your clan to validate it for you (IF you can manage to get in one) but almost all clans have requirements so goodluck with that, you need around 500-1000 crowns for people to acutally accept you into a clan which takes a considerable amount of time and fustration. Since if you lose in any sort of way you lose crown and quite a lot of crowns depending on where you try to attack. And people can plunder your castle so that also means you can still lose crowns even when you're offline or online. Unless you got loads of cash to throw at this game, don't bother.",1
2009,"Gah i just can't get around the controls and combat and how annoying alotof things get. I clearly jump over the fire and still get hit in midair. There's just not enough abilities and skills. I want to be able to smash in buttons and combo like a madman. But in abyss there's only few attacks that don't really do much, having to rely alot on specials.

Menu doesn't loadup either. << fixed but still crashes randomly mid-game.Now that i've actually MADE it in-game. After having to change the launcher code, it's a decent game and the similarity between darksouls and LOTF are spot on. Dodging mechanics, one-handed/Two handed-mode and not being to greedy with boss fights and planning out routes and enemies patterns.The castles and armor styles are pretty damn amazing i must say though that's for sure.Only thing that worried me the most was huge fps drop even though i'm playing on a 780ti GTX geforce NVIDIA. And you would sometimes crash mid-game, not sure why still.Can't give this an up JUST yet until some patches/fixes come to the game, for the time being ill keep playing.",1

I am glad I purchased this while it was on sale,  because I do not believe it is worth the full price. I regret paying even the $10 that I did.Please save yourself the time and money and just do not buy this. It is not worth it.",1

2009,"What can I say about game?It is one of the best games I have played this year.I was not a fan of the Elite games until recent I got my hands on Sniper Elite V2.This game is magnificient, the open world of the maps of Africa are extraordinary. The old and new mechanics are refined and are brilliant, much better than previous game.AI has improved from previous game. However they are still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but are so fun to kill.There is also a lot more customisation with rifles, loadout and lots more.Multiplayer is great, however needs more people and some touches.Only problem is some glitches it has like invisible Ammo Boxes ad bodies spazzing everywhere.What else can I say?All I can say is..... GET THE GAME EVEN THOUGH ITS EXPENSIVE ITS WORTH IT!!!!!",1
2009,One of the best sniper games I have played up to date. I was not a fan intially but thanks to V2 I feel like getting V3.,1
2009,"Final Fantasy IV, what can I say about this game?First off I ain't much of fan of the Final Fantasy Series but when I tried Final Fantasy IV it changed what I initally though of it.This HD Remake is brilliant, the music like in any other Final Fantasy Game is absolute. Its fine orchestral melodies give a fantastic atmosphere in-game. The combat system is pretty basic and lovely, I am still not a fan of it since I prefer more of a Turn-Based Mechanic like Civilization and so on. Still its good but I stress everytime when I am doing a move and if I click on the wrong menu I am losing precious seconds giving the enemy AI an opportunity to defeat my party. The Story is great, you play as a Dark Knight called Cecil (Or in my game ♥♥♥) who follows the orders of supreme tyrant king. He and his Red Wings go to the City of Mysidia and attack on its peaceful people for its crystal. I won't go on any longer with the story, but becomes interesting the more you know. The Characters in game are all facinating and quite lively, the cut-scenes in the game include voice-overs which I found great. Finally, Final Fantasy IV succeeds on being a True JRPG, the only thing I had problem with  was what to do next? In this game, I am told what to do and when accomplish I just don't know what to do or go where. A bit more guidance in-game would have done the trick. Also this game has very good ""Engrish,"" you will notice some when you read the text carefully.Overall this game I found it a  good rendition on my Steam Library and cannot wait for more of the Final Fantasy Games to get on steam. The is excellent fulfulling what a JRPG should do with excellent music, interesting story and well-thought characters. In addition, has some faults with guidance in-game and contains some well written ""Engrish.""",1
2009,"Fable Anniversary is a ""HD Remake of the Original Extended Version Fable: The Lost Chapters."" Keep in mind it is the ""HD Remake"" not ""Fable 4."" So many people are giving this game a bad name for the wrong reasons, its been 10 Years since the release of the original game and to celebrate Lionheart have done a HD Remake of their game, of course it will run the same.Now lets talk about the gameplay. Fable Anniversary has been masterfully re-crafted the original Fable with beautiful textures. Its absolutely stunning, I could not help myself staring at the landscape while being ganked by couple of those filthy hobbes and bandits. The game ran smoothly for me and could not help myself reminicise good moments when I was playing Fable TLC. Combat system is still fantastic like its predecessor although some of the enemies I thought were just cheap and annoying. The NPCs are still funny and a tad stupid like one time I just went to the Bowerstone Inn for a Quest when random villagers kept applauding and laughing at me when I was trying to have a chat with a Quest Giver. The story for me is still excellent and lovely. Pretty much my experience with this game have been awesome the only problems were some of the bugs that were initally on before the update. Controls for the PC are a bit strange and would personally recommend controller. Now everything is great. Even though the game might not seem new this game has ""mods"" which will definitely have some bonuses. So overall, this game I would recommend to people, even though people might say this game is trash it is their opinion. For me I love this game and is a great HD-Remake Port for the PC.",1

2008,"Great game, I've already played almost 20 hours on this game and yet I havn't explored nearly all you can do yet. PROS/CONSPROS: -Almost endless possiblities to design and creativity-Great source of items-Great landscapes (choosing from a generated world or a flat world)CONS: -Due to early stages, the game, for me, can do a lot more, so I'm hoping it'll become more interesting WHAT THIS GAME COULD INCLUDE IN THE FUTURE: -Changes in weather, i.e Day/night, Clear/cloudy-Ladders -No clip mode if there isn't already one (for creative only) -Water (for possible boat/submarine creations) -More of a variety of size in the items (excluding building blocks since they already have this feature)Over all, very good game, I can't wait for further changes. 9/10 for me, and when the game is complete, a definate 10/10!",1

It has worked, so far, but there will probably be something that ruins my experience AGAIN, later on. Buy it, and enjoy the game while you can.",1

2006,get this game it is fun to play and adicting. it can be a rage game when getting into the harder levels but thats all part of the challenge :),1
2006,Race the sun is an action packed arcade feeling game that you can pick up and just play. The fast paced action allows for players to feel the speed and intensity of racing to the horizon of the map dodging obstacles that lie ahead. the gameplay is very smooth and controller support adds that extra controll to the game. the overall map layout could be a bit more colourful but other than that this game wants you to try and get that high score. overall i would rate this a 9.5/10 because it is a great game and i really recomend it to players of all ages and skills,1

2007,e mt bom,1
2004,Great sandbox. Just for messing around and the gamemodes are addicting. I give it a 8/10. It just lacks story. (There is none) but we can cut it some slack just because it's a sandbox game.,1

2006,"When I bought the game onsale for $0.14 I thought ""ah what the hell, it might be okay"". After playing it for about 20 minutes I fell in love with this simple yet fun 2d platformer. It was challenging figuring out how I could kill myself in each level, and those damn key levels and boss fights were pretty tough. Its a fun game to spend a couple of hours on and move on (However I think I've spent like 15 hours on it), and is a nice lighthearted game. Its texture are basics and the game mechanics are sometimes buggy, but I reckon you should pick it up, especially if it is on sale.",2

2006,10/10 would kuble wagon again.,1
2007,"This game, can be good at times, don't get me wrong. It can also be enjoyable, and playing with friends is great too, but there are some majour issues that need to be addressed. For example, for some reason (and not just me) when ever your ping starts to f*ck up, so does your fps, you can be running normally at ultra at 60fps on a 980 (like me) and then just randomly get fps drops that you think is just ping lag, before you realise, nope its your computer. I know somebody with a 980ti that also has the same problem. That's not the only problem, for some reason, i had these HUGE LIGHTS that were apearing out of no where, and almost making me blind. The PC Au servers, are also, terrible (at least there dedicated this time) but still bad, you can one round have the best ping, and then next, awful ping, and my internet isn't even that bad (and i have australian internet ahha). The games killing system and aiming could also be improved... *doesn't help that im not that good of an aim ahah* but still after playing CS:GO for example, i can be doing well in that, and finding that when i get killed its ""oh okay, fair enough"" and when i get a kill ""well that was good"" in BO3, its like when you get killed ""OMG WHAT THE F*CK, HES HACKING OMG THATS SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T"" and when you get a kill ""no way i got that?"" and thats just a few things to name. It's also very buggy, and you can tell that it has been rushed, either that or its just a bad console peasent to PC port. I had high hopes for this game, and im not impressed, at all. I did enjoy zombies though and found that enjoyable, and is most likely keeping me from refunding it, its just MP need's to be improved ALOT. Cheers",1
1998,This is awesome,1
2002,Its a great little game to play and it helps you burn time. its like TF2 just less stressing. recommended to all. overall 8 out of 10,1
1999,Spintired is a decent game that performs well in most areas but slightly lacks in others. A few problems I see with it are that the missions and objectives do get a bit repetitive and can take a very long while to complete. Also in my opinion with the graphics turned all the way up the game still lacked in image quality. Apart from those things this is a good game and wpuld recommend this to any serious gamer.,1

2004,"One of few apocalypse survival games that truly grows from the community. The dev works on this everyday and is always looking for feedback and opinions on how the game is shaped, also constantly putting out strawpolls to the community and listens to us.Unturned is played how you want, example, if you only want PVE you can select your server and if you want a PVP experience with your PVE you can select PVP enabled on your server, and yes, you can host your own servers on your computer.It starts out like many other apocalypse survival games: you start out with your fists and 4 slots for your inventory. You have a lot of places you can wander to when you spawn, like a cabin camp, small town, military base, and many more. Your main mission when you start is to grab a melee, some food with drink, and a backpack. Once you've acquired these necessities, you may wish to find a gun if you want to PVP, or you may want to collect seeds to start a farm, or even start chopping down trees to make yourself a cozy place to spend the night.The PVP system is great also, server hosts can select if players can bring in loot from their server (best for PVP) or not be able to bring loot in (Best for PVE Immersion). Their is a leaning system so you can peek corners also. You can also SHOOT OUT OF CARS (but not from the drivers seat of course)! Load some of your buddies in the trunk of your truck and do a hillbilly drive-by if you wish!The towns are well structured for PVP also, their are lot of CQC battles to be fought, and also small hills for sniping, but snipers can be easily flanked if you don't post up right!Base raiding is also important in PVP too. People on public servers will build structured bases equipped with sniper pits, plenty of windows, and escape routes! You must observe a player's base and attack it strategically, you never know how many players may be in there!Now, time to farm my crops and build my base, I recommend you do so also!",0

2017,I've only played 6 hours but I find this game very entertaing. Its fast paced gameplay gives you a challenge aswell as the HRV to replace the absence of the map. Overall i give it a 8.5/10 because i can't seem to find any aussie servers :(,1

2017,"A great zobie fps, multiplayer game. The devs are contstatly adding features, since it is earlt access. If you ever played Dayz mod, this is a step up in my opinion in terms of graphics and game play. Encounters with players are fun and can lead to intresting situations.

2017,Amazing :),2
2017,"This game reminds me of Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy X ( the Final Fantasy franchise that I played ). Also, do not use the DLC Characters particularly Peashy and Plutia, while progressing to chapter 2, if you intend on playing the game as it is meant to be. Otherwise, go ahead. I will not include a pros and cons. Instead I will replace with things you should expect. Overall, if you enjoy watching the anime and manga, chances are, you are going to enjoy the game.Things to expect : Fan Services Moe Some monster models are reused Stupendously Huge Chest VS Flat Chest Farming for Plans ( These plans are basically items, such as weapons, outfits and so on ) Leveling of characters, partner ranks",1
2017,"The game has a lot of problems, and I am going to list a few of them. Character facing the wrong side. ( This is probably a bug ) No tutorial. Difficulties playing with keyboard. ( Some of the movements that you may want to learn ( located in WAZA ),   requires a controller to execute but fret not, there is a way to learn all the movements ) If you double tap your d key, it will dash forward. However, tapping excessively may cause it to continuously dash. Occasionally, whenever I am in the menu ( in game menu, not the title screen menu ), my game may go into spasm mode, denying me from saving the game to selecting what I am going to train next.Is there a saving grace for this game? Yes there is, make such amendments to the file, kmslot1 ( not going to go into full detail since there is guide for this ), and max out your stats. However, there is still a low - moderate probability of you getting your ♥♥♥ beat by the AI.",1

2017,"Hero Siege é um jogo perfeito. É um RPG muito diferente do que os normais, com uma jogabilidade quase única, além disso apresenta uma dificuldade intensa que desafia os players mais ""hardcore"".Pontos positivos + :-Jogabilidade única;-Temática diferenciada;-Musiquinhas show;-Dificuldade intensa (é sério, no modo mais facil ja é muito dificil);-Grande quantidade de personagens FREE;-Skills boladas;-Grande quantidade de saves.Pontos negativos - :-Personagens PAGOS (não gosto muito de jogos pagos onde tem coisas pagas neles);-Não gosto de ratos assassinos gigantes.",1
2017,"O jogo em si é muito bom, tem personagens interessantes e uma jogabilidade boa, o mapa e as missões sao praticamente iguais tornando o jogo meio monótono, mas o maior problema dele é que simplesmente enjoa... vc começa a jogar e seu objetivo principal e comprar sobreviventes melhores e mais interessantes, mas os prêmios das partidas são tão baixos que você acaba cansando mesmo antes de comprar aquele tão esperado personagem boladão.7/10 divertido e legal mas é extremamente enjoativo.",1

2017,Awesome Adventuring game!! +,1
2017,Awesome game ,1
2017,i would reccomend this game for older kids that are older then 12 because u will want your kids to sleep and u dont want them to rade Lol.,1
2017,awesome game but the only bad thing is its the same as tf2 but just re-skin of characters. so im putting it as a thumbs down. sorry for the people who like it.,1
2017,awesome game.,1

2017,"Not really a good game, its pretty boring and I wish there were more game modes. Its overpriced and has some bugs that need fixing. It still has a good gameplay but I wish it was better. In conclusion its a 4.5/10",2
2017,when i try to launch it it keeps saying that it stopped working!!,1
2017,This is a game filled with strategy elements as well as a good shooter. I had trouble aiming with a controller but besides that is is absolutely worth the 50 cents i got it for.,1
2017,"Challenging game and mind numbing, but it is a great and addicting game. I hate it when you place the block in the wrong place!",1
2017,THE BEST GAME EVEEEEER!!!I've played the campaign about 6 times over and i love every update. Aliens was awesome and i'm hoping to see some more interesting features added to the game. Great for when the gang get together and i certainly had a laugh flying on those pigs. DEFFINATELY WORTH THE 15 DOLLARS,1
2017,Great game only played a bit but already the feel of mordor is terrifying. THere are no bugs and the NPC humans are funny.  I spent my money well and i cant wait to keep playing.,1
2017,"As a fan of the Call Of Duty Franchise i have to say i'm very disapointed in Black Ops 3. Not to brag but i was very good at the other call of duty games but the mix of jetpacks, sliding and wall running all with the same mechanics as the old call of dutys just does not work for me. I've played about 10 multiplayer games so far and have had no fun what so ever. Gun customization would have been great if they added a free draw tool instead of having to move various shapes and size them correctly. Originally i bought the game for zombies. Shadows of Evil (only map so far) is very different from other COD Zombies i have played and has a massive area. Ive played 3 games and continuously get lost in the maze of zombie filled streets, downing countless times far away from my team mates. As for graphics, my Geforce 740m couldnt handle the high graphic setting so i had to lower everything including shadows, player models and textures down to medium and my render quality to 80% in order for me to have smooth game play. To finish of this review I'm going to conclude that im disapointed in this new addition to the series and i hope they can release a WW1 or WW2 game or maybe even anoth MW. I didnt mind advanced warfare but BO3 certainly puts the icing on the cake then just ♥♥♥♥ing picks up the cake and throws it out the window onto your neighbour's cat who then screams in agony because it's allergic to chocolate so you have to go to the vet with your grumpy old neighbour and finally after 20 minutes of waiting you are given the news from the vet that the cat will never see. Your neighbour is extremly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and start to pull out his gun but you pull your magnificent gun which is designed with a ♥♥♥♥♥ spirting ♥♥♥♥♥ out of your back pocket and fire 20 bullets into his skull only to find out you had monitor lag and he shoots you twice and somehow kills you. That kiddies is why you should not wastes over 40 bucks on this game, go buy MW...",1
2017,The game is AWESOME and is F2PReasons why u should get this game1: this is i very good looking game as if it is in HD2:LOADS of weapon and character customization. MORE THAN TEAM FORTRESS 2!3.you can get loads of stuff by just playing it 4 freeGET THIS GAME AS IT IS AWESOME!,1

2018,"After a total of 600 Hours of playtime in this game, I can honestly say this is my favorite game. Its just so goooood. In terms of gameplay its just like a normal FPS, but its better because of the variety in weapons and in specail skills. While my favorite is the gunzerker, which can dual wield weapons, Other specails include turning invisible, trapping people in inescapable aurasphere thing, and summoning turrets are all extremely diverse and compelling abilities. 10/10 by far",1

2018,"画面 8.5分/10分 剧情 5分/10分1.首先画面和优化很赞，代入感很强，虽然每个区域都有沙漠，但是各有特色，不同的山和峡谷开车逛逛感觉也很不错，但是设定和刺客信条极度相似。开放世界，每次将气球升到最高处才能获得一片区域的视野和建筑。2.剧情任务给我感觉十分无聊，就是到营地里杀杀小兵，捡些scrap,小兵基本长得一样，偶尔有个拿盾牌的，把该炸掉的炸了基本就完了。3.战斗系统没有什么变化，那一套连招狂点左键加格挡已经无敌了，4.武器系统只有散弹枪 狙击枪，散弹枪用起来手感巨差，射速慢，子弹少。5.车辆改装大赞，不过没耐心的人到处跑图收集零件也是很无奈的。6.总之，作为一款电影游戏，画面还原的不错，剧情和电影中基本没有交叉，剧情和战斗没有太多新意，收集要素太多，不适合没耐心的玩家。",1
1999,"Very fun to play, but what ever you do, DO NOT GET INVESTED IN THE GAME! IT WILL E THE END to you and your PC! (Collateral Damage)",1
2000,"Great Game if you love Science, Explosions or Building Random stuff that can blow up in your Face!",1
2018,"Was a very good game during BETA,Unless planetary weapons have been balanced, such as the planet-destroying laser, the game is lopsided.Would Not recommend unless changes are made, as initial leader in unit fabrication will most likely develop this planet laser first. As the weapon has no use limit, you are free to destroy every planet until the enemy command comes to your planet.I wish the beta was back :(",1
